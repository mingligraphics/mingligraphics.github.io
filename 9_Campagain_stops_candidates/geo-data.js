[cheers and applause] (music)(music) [music] (music)(music) [indiscernible] [applause] [pledge of allegiance] [indiscernible]\nour c-span road to the white house coverage continuing as we wait for this event with democratic presidential candidate kamala harris to get underway and as we wait, let's bring you a portion of \"washington journal.\"\nindependent institute senior fellow ivan eiland is on your screen. he studies the executive branch and legislative branch and powers of both. when it comes to declaring a national emergency, from where does a president derive that specific power?\nthat's interesting because i think the framers of the constitution will frown on any declaration of emergency power. this has developed over time as the executive has become much more powerful than framers intended. the framers of the constitution, to give a little background, they sort of rejected the national emergency paradigm because the american constitution is not set up to be efficient legislation. people criticize congress or government in washington for not being more efficient passing things but of course the system is designed to slow things up. the system of checks and balances is primarily to spread out power so that you don't have tyranny and not only the tyranny of the executive because they had the king george model of britain in mind but also legislative tyranny because the british parliament they felt was a tyrannical body, as well, effect on them. so what they did was, the only thing that resembles the national emergency in the original constitution is that they can suspend, raise habeas corpus, during invasions or insurrections. those are pretty dire circumstances and they don't mention a general national emergency because i think they would have been very uncomfortable with it. this declaration of national emergency have been trivialized and they were building up in the early 1970's, i think, hundreds of them. i think almost 500 at once. so this national emergencies act of 1976 was actually designed to sunset some of those and rein in the practice. well, it reined in to some extent because now we only have 30 and we had 59 since then and some have gone away but we have about 31 right now. so one might ask, well, is this all that serious? well, most of these emergencies have been used to sanction other countries and there's been largely an agreement, there's been abuse by the executive but congress has abdicated authority by allowing this to happen so we sort of trivialize these things. (music)(music) [music] (music)(music)\nhi, everyone. hi! it's great to be with you! it's great to be in the granite state! thank you, guys! all right, obviously, we're going to be here a while. thank you, madam speaker. i called terry before my visit to just check in and get some advice and counsel. you have been a trail blazer in your career and i cannot thank you enough for your role of leaper -- leadership and for introducing me this afternoon. thank you. thank you. thank you all so very much for being here. it's a holiday. it is snowing outside and there are many things you can could be doing with your time but that you've chosen to spend it being here means the world to me and obviously is a reflection of the leaders who are in this room and how much we all care about our country so i thank you. [applause]\nthank you, thank you. i just arrived this morning and the press -- i did a couple of, like they call it a gaggle. a couple of press interviews. one of the first questions, i just want to get this out of the way. the elephant in the room. no, we're not going to have any elephants in the room. [laughter] get the elephants out of the room. i intend to compete in new hampshire. i intend to spend time here. i intend to shake every hand that i possibly can. i want to talk with you. i want to listen to you. i want to be challenged by you. i want to ensure that at the end of this process we are relevant and the only way that will be achieved is by spending time with leaders such as those in this church and having the opportunity to have many conversations and have conversations in depth so i'm here to tell you i plan on spending time in new hampshire. i plan on competing in new hampshire. i plan on doing very well in new hampshire. [cheers and applause] [laughter]\nso that is my intention. and i am going to work toward it. so i am here to listen, not even more than i intend to talk but i'm going to share with you a few thoughts that i have and then we're going to open it up for a conversation and take questions. we announced this campaign just a little over three weeks ago, in my home town of oakland, california. [cheering]\nand people have been asking me, why are you running? so i'll tell you. there are a number of reasons. one, i love our country. i love our country. and i know what we are capable of. i know who we are, what we believe in, the values, the principles upon which we were founded and i'm prepared to fight for those. i also believe that we are looking at an america today where american values and the american dream are under attack and we have got to stand to defend those dreams and ideals and values. i also believe that it is time to restore opportunity for all americans in this country, not just a few, not just the top 1%, not just big corporations, but everyone. and right now in our country we are looking at extreme inequities and we have to correct course and i guess the final plan is there. my sister and i -- she's here, maya. we were raised by a mother who, when we'd come home and talk about this happened or this problem and complaining about something, the first thing she'd say is, well, what are you going to do about it? so i decided to run for president of the united states. [laughter] [cheering]\nso there you go. so it is a time to restore truth and justice in our country. many of you know my background includes, and the speaker told you part of my background was i was a prosecutor for many years. i prosecuted everything including homicides. i believe this is a moment in time to restore truth and justice. let's take a look at where we are. it's an inflection point. we're at an inflection point in the history of our country and actually in the world. this is a moment in time that is requiring each of us and collectively to look in a mirror and ask this question -- who are we? and i believe part of the answer to that question is, we are better than this. we are better than this. [applause]\nand so this is a moment that is requiring us to fight for the best of who we are and fight for those principles behind that word \"justice.\" so let's take a look in the mirror and see where we have been. it is not justice to have a system where you give a one trillion dollars tax credit to the top 1% and the big corporations of america. that is not justice. it is not justice when we separate babies from their mothers and fathers at the border. [applause]\nand claim -- and claim that that's about border security when, in fact, what it is is a human rights abuse. it is not justice, in a country that -- that values civil society, that we do not pass gun safety laws because of fear of lobbyists -- [cheering]\ninstead of understanding that our values should be about protecting our babies when they go to school, protecting people where they worship and understanding that we should never bow down to those who have a lot of money because we are afraid that we may not win re-election when people are dying in our streets. [cheers and applause]\nso we've got to fight for truth and justice. truth. let's speak some truth. you know, i think we all know right now there are a lot of folks who rightly are feeling quite distrustful of their government and its institutions and leaders and the thing about a relationship of trust is this. the very nature of a relationship of trust is such that it is a reciprocal relationship. you give and you receive trust. and one of the most important trust is truth. but there is a funny thing about truth. speaking truth often makes people quite uncomfortable. and for those of us who have these microphones and stand behind podiums, there is an incentive that when we speak, everyone will feel lovely and they will applaud and sprinkle lovely dust all over the room, and everyone will have had a good day. speaking truth doesn't always accomplish that goal. here is the other thing which we all know. people may walk away from that conversation thinking, i didn't like what i had to hear. people will also walk away knowing it was an honest conversation. so let's speak some truths. as we attempt to restore trust. you are looking at me, what do you have in mind? let's speak truth. america right now is not working for working people. i will tell you how i know that. when we know that almost half of families in america cannot afford a $400 unexpected emergency, that it will pull them in a spiral, we know we must speak truth that america right now is not working for working people. when we know that in our country today, in do not -- in 99% of the counties of the united states, if you are a minimum wage worker working full-time you cannot afford market rate for a full bedroom apartment. [applause] we know america is not working for working people, which is why i propose we change the tax code to reflect the needs of working people and in particular as it relates to working families making less than $100,000 a year, i propose a tax credit that they get to collect $500 a month to be able to meet the cost of living because we have to recognize. some people want to walk around touting the economy is great. let me tell you, i have been traveling this country talking to folks. i am meeting folks who say, you can talk about unemployment numbers, i am working. i am working two and three jobs. my wages aren't meeting the cost of living, gas, rent, utilities. we have got to speak these truths. let's speak the truth. let's speak the truth about education. we are a society that pretends to care about education. not so much of the education of other people's children. let's speak that truth. let's speak that truth. let's agree. [applause] that we have failed to put the resources into our public education system and instead we are putting tons of money into a system of mass incarceration. [applause and cheers] because we are not being smart about investing in the future of our country. let's speak these truths. and meanwhile we have an administration that puts in place ahead of the department of education that talks more about grizzly bears than children who needs (music) resources. and is trying to privatize the public education system of this country. let's speak these truths. let's speak the truth that in this country today, many if not most american families are just short of bankruptcy because of inability to pay a hospital bill. let's speak that truth. and that the truth also is health care and access to health care should not be a privilege, it should be a right. [applause and cheers] which is why i support medicare for all. [applause and cheers] let's speak truth. if charlottesville did not make it clear, if the tree of life synagogue did not make it clear, racism and anti-semitism, homophobia, transforming a -- trans-phobia are real. let's speak these truths so we can deal with them. [applause and cheers] and let's speak one of the most important truths that this time must be spoken when we have such powerful forces that are trying to sow hate and division among us. the most important truth i believe we must know in our heads and hearts is the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. let's speak that truth. [applause and cheers] and i know that to be true. i know that to be true. we are a beautifully diverse country. look at the weather outside that window and imagine what it is like in hawaii right now. [laughter] we have all kinds of diversity, of religion and race and ethnicity at topography and industry grew we could go on and on we are a beautifully diverse country. some would suggest that within diversity it is not possible to achieve unity. there are so many differences. how can we achieve unity. i will to you this. the way we achieve unity is my understanding yes, we are diverse and have so much more in common than what separates us. i think about it in the context of what some of us call the middle of the night thought. others the 3:00 in the morning thought. the witching hour, you know what i am talking about. in the middle of the night when you wake up with that thing that has been weighing on you in a cold sweat, for the vast majority of us when we wake up, had that moment thinking that thought that has been waiting on us, it is never through the lens of the party with which we are registered to vote. it is never through the lens of some demographic a pollster put us in. for the vast majority of us when we wake up thinking that thought, it has to do with one of very few things, personal health, the health of our children, parents. for so many americans, can i keep a job, pay the bills, retire with dignity? for so many parents, can i get my child access to treatment for their opioid addiction? for so many students, can i pay off those student loans? the majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. as we go forward and fight this good fight, let's hold on to that. let's not let anyone take that away from us. [applause] and let's remember our strengths as a nation. in the last two years there has been a lot that has happened that has caused us to shout at the tv, throw things, individual group therapy. [laughter] but let's hold on to something. let's hold on to an image i will share with you that i have witnessed in -- i have been in the senate two years. my office is in the hrart building on the first floor. i have seen thousands of dreamers descend on our nations capital traveling by bus, train, car, sleeping i am sure 10 deep on someone's living room floor, merging the halls of congress believing that if they are seen and their stories heard, it will matter. i have seen the same thing with these teenagers from parkland and their parents traveling, merging. requiring -- marching, requiring people to see and hear them. i saw it with parents who came with children to fight during the affordable care act, who brought children at various levels of disability, families for whom it is an effort to move the child from one room of the house to another. travel across the country, walking those holes, believing if they were seen and their stories heard, it would matter. i talked with survivors around the kavanaugh hearing who by the hundreds, most of whom had never told their story to anyone and had the courage and the conviction to travel to our nation's capital, believing if they were heard, it wouldn't -- it would matter. there is an incredible amount of power in the people of our country. conviction and hopefulness. we cannot lose that. we must hold on to that as we go forward to 2020. we must remember we are a nation that part of our strength is those principles and ideals upon which we were founded, that were present in the writing of the constitution of the united states and all of its amendments, declaration of independence, the ideals behind those words we have spoken in 1776 that we all should be treated as equals. part of the strength of our nation is we were founded on noble ideals and we made a commitment to fight to achieve those. we are an aspirational nation. let's also be clear eyed. we have not met those ideals. we know that. but our nature is to fight to achieve them. we cannot lose that aspirational nature because that is part of our strength. when i think about this moment, that is what i think about where we are and who we are. my final point is this, and then questions and comments, whatever anyone would like to say. years from now our children, grandchildren, they will look in each of our eyes. you may look in somebody's eyes. they will look, they will look in our eyes, and they will ask us where were you at that inflection moment? what we will be able to say is we were hanging out in this church together and our answer to that question is going to be so much more than how we felt at this moment. our answer will be what we did, what action we took that we stood up, stood out, we stood up, marched, shouted, did everything we can to fight for the best of who we are. that is what we will tell them. that is what we will tell them. [applause] that is what we will tell them. [applause] ok, questions?\nok, they told me i get to ask the first question. i hear a lot every day about how the democratic party has become a party of the coasts. i also here at the same time people telling me we have to have -- they are more concerned than ever about the candidate coming out of the democratic primary that can actually win in the general election. my question is what will your campaign look like and how will you reach your message to the heartland of our country? [applause]\nthank you. for starters i plan on prosecuting the case against people who do not tell the truth and who are purveyors of the injustice in this country. that case will be successfully prosecuted because there is a lot of evidence of injustice and a lack of truth and commitment to working people. it is also going to be a matter of understanding back to the commonality. i reject the notion that depending on where you were born , you don't identify with or care or connect with someone else. ultimately this election will come down to who the american public believes will be a leader . a leader in a way that also understands power is about understanding and caring and having an interest in the lives of people other than oneself. [applause] and then acting on their needs as opposed to self interest. and ultimately my experience having run an office of over 5000 people as attorney general, the work in the united states senate and the work i know it happened around really restoring america's role and standing on the globe is going to be critically important. i am prepared to do it. [applause]\nright here. there is a microphone coming around to you.\nhi, take -- thank you for taking my question and thank you for talking about the truth. that is refreshing and i was happy to hear you talking about medicare for all. i have a 14-year-old son who has a life-threatening disability. he requires medication he carries with him everywhere he goes and has since he was two and will the rest of his life. we have had the experience of drug rices being risen -- prices raising. so i am wondering if you would consider cosponsoring a senate bill, 102, the drug company pricing bill that will protect consumers from drug companies doing this, using monopolies by taking patents from drug companies when they exploit consumers in this way and particularly with charging american 10 times more than people in other countries. it would make me feel safer for my son in this country. [applause]\nthank you. i think i am on that legislation. i know i have been supportive in the past. i can check on that, but first of all, thank you for having the courage to tell your story. i think more people need to understand and see you and parents like you and individuals like you and understand what it really means to go through the health care system in this country because far too many are playing political games and don't understand what it is like to be an individual who needs health care or be the family member and loving someone who needs to go through this system. i will share you my personal experience. my mother, who raised us, passed away a few years ago. after having cancer. my mother was a ferocious woman who after you met her you would have thought she was seven feet tall but she was five feet. she was a breast cancer researcher and had two goals in her life, to raise her daughters and end breast cancer. she ended up having cancer. going through that system with her, you know, i will never forget meeting a nurse who said has anyone talked to you about anticipatory grief? i had never heard the term but it explains everything. when you are going through the health care system with someone facing an acute illness and you are already grieving their departure, you don't realize it. you are going through a process of hoping that your son is not in pain, of monitoring the reaction that someone has to the medication they are being given, making sure that the medical health professionals who are treating them are on top of their needs and are responding to the feedback they are giving, making sure trying to figure out how you can be creative and giving something they might actually eat or want to eat because they don't have an appetite. worrying physically where they will be when they are out of the hospital. for people to have two go through that is an incredible, emotional, physical -- i don't want to say burden. it is what you do, but it is very difficult. then on top of that to require people to have to pay that bill, that is not the sign of a civil society. my mother did have medicare. it was not our concern but it is the concern of many in the system. a contributor to that is the pharmaceutical companies who are -- let's talk about the opioid crisis in america today. these affirmance or companies are pushing this drug knowing of its side effects and not appropriately informing the public. let's talk about how they have been gouged, the public has been couched in terms of any drugs that can actually help people through recovery. it is a system that is immoral because the way it is working right now and the way pharmaceutical companies are working, for the most part it is clear their motivation is profit, not public health. [applause]\nit is immoral when you are talking about health, talking about health and so medicare for all, one of the reasons i support it is because when it would be achieved, we would be able to negotiate on behalf of of all of us against the pharmaceutical companies. which means we would be able to bring down prices and have more influence around greater access to generics and not have pharmaceutical companies shutdown competition because they are afraid competition means the prices would go down and the quality might go up. i am i in board -- i am all on board. thank you for your story. i know it is not easy. how about right here? [applause]\nthank you for taking my question. i am part of a grassroots indivisible new hampshire group that has been working in new hampshire to oppose voter suppression. you may remember new hampshire was ground zero for voter suppression in 2016 when trump declared busloads of the legal voters the reason he lost the state to hillary clinton. then the secretary of state joined the kovac commission and voter suppression laws were passed. voting rights is a core issue for me and many of the members. i am an aclu voter and care about civil liberties. my question is what you commit to passing a modern voting rights act that would incentivize states to adopt same day and automatic voter registration and expand early and mail in voting opportunities and make election day a national holiday?\nabsolutely. absolutely. absolutely. yeah. absolutely, no question. [applause] and if i may, i want to contribute to your point. in the 2018 election cycle we saw massive voter suppression taking place. remember 2013 the united states supreme court in shelby versus holder gutted the voting rights act. it had only been around like 50 years. part of what it gutted was the provision that recognized certain states had a history of voter suppression and therefore should be monitored. it removed the requirement basically of monitoring those states. guess what happened almost immediately afterwards? something like 20 something states, their legislatures, put in place voter restrictions to the point that one, there was a case out of north carolina was challenged because it was so obviously restrictive. the court of appeals said, i will quote, that the law they put in place was so outrageous that -- \"with surgical precision attempted to dissuade black voters from voting.\" we saw it in 2015 around native american voters grew we saw it in 2018 with students. voter suppression is happening across the nation. i absolutely support it but i would also say this to all of the leaders here. 2020, we are not only going to see these attempts happen again, so let's be prepared for it, right -- we will litigate. the aclu does an extraordinary job areas so does the naacp. -- job. so does the naacp. what we also have to do it as organizers is think about how we will and start doing it now, how we will try and make it as easy as possible for our neighbors across the country to vote because we can guarantee there will be suppression. and the second point, the other voter manipulation is russia. let's get ready. let's get ready for that. because we have the tools sadly because we have been used to voter suppression in the classic way, this is a whole other thing. i have a bill, bipartisan bill, with a republican from oklahoma, he and i are the only two members of the senate to have served on homeland security and senate intelligence at the same time. we have a bill that basically would require states to upgrade elections infrastructure because going back to the future, the best and smartest way, paper ballots. paper ballots. i joke and i say paper ballots because russia can't hack a piece of paper. but we also have to pay attention to that latest version of what will happen around attempting to manipulate the american people as we vote. count me in.\nlet's go over here. i saw a hand.\nhi. i am the union -- i am a union man. [applause] up until three years ago a federal employee at the naval shipyard, 40 years at the shipyard. [applause] i am sure there are union brothers and sisters in this room, shipyarders in this room. personally i am tired of the way labor unions and federal employees are being vilified and subjected to terrible legislation that is not exclusive to the republican party. i want to know senator what you are doing now as a senator and what you will do as president to level the playing field for unions and to help restore the reality of the dignity of federal employees.\nthank you, thank you for that. [applause] i agree with you. let me start from the beginning. i have long supported organized labor. they have long supported me. i have walked picket lines. i am with you. there has been an erosion of labor and organized labor and we have seen it in wisconsin and others because there are powerful interests that no when working people unite especially around collective bargaining that working in the win. there are some who have decided it is a zero-sum game not understanding that when working people win, america wins, that when working people have the wages and benefits commensurate with the value they perform but it flips -- it uplifts families and society we have challenges because there has been a wholesale attack on organized labor. have seen it in particular out of this administration. i will stand with labor. we got the five day work week. the holiday have today, right? sick leave? we don't have family paid leave but we are working on that. any working person owes a debt of gratitude to organized labor in this country. [applause] how about let's go over here? there is a mic ready.\nthere are a lot of challenges but the most important is climate change. what can you do -- [applause]\ni was trying not to go too long with all of my truths but let's speak a truth that is one of the most fundamental truths. climate change israel. [applause and cheers] -- change is real, and it poses an existential threat to us as human beings. and it is within our power to do something about it. [applause] let's all be clear, we are not talking about a meteor that might hit the planet. we are talking about human behaviors that are contributing directly to greenhouse gas emissions. we are talking about human behaviors that are resulting -- you know it here in this region, to what we need around clean drinking water. our need as human beings to breathe clean air, and we are at a moment where we are about to throw away the future of our planet for our children and grandchildren. it is an immediate threat and we have to understand this with a great sense of urgency. i will tell you i find it outrageous and malpractice that this administration would have you writing science fiction instead of -- buying science-fiction instead of science fact, that there is a hand trying to feed big coal and oil instead of understanding the best interests of the people of this planet. our role of leadership, we have not even begun this evening to talk about how we are seething -- we are ceding our position among neighbors around the globe . it is outrageous. [applause] i am supporting the green new deal. [applause and cheers] we have to have goals, and we have to -- it is a revolution that requires us to have goals and think about what we can achieve and what metrics on it. some of them will achieve, some of them we will not. if we don't aspire, this will be a bad ending. i don't want to sound like an alarmist but it is very real and within our power. in california and other states we have seen at the state level that makes a difference. but this is a challenge of whether or not there will be leaders. clearly we don't have a leader in the white house on this. [applause]\nright back here. stand up, the microphone will come over to you.\nthank you for taking my question. in the last 15 or 20 years, suicide rates have been on the rise. i have seen the shortcomings the mental health care system offers its patience. i was wondering what your administration would do to alleviate this.\nthat is a great question. thank you for sharing that. i believe very strongly we should have a national policy around mental health care and substance abuse treatment on demand. [applause] that is what i am proposing. just like you can go into an emergency room anywhere and get care, you should be able to walk into a treatment facility and receive care. what we know when we are looking at everything from suicide rates to drug addiction, there was a direct connection between either the presence in areas of research or not. when i think about it i also understand that part of the challenge we have as a country is we haven't done enough to put resources into creating incentives for people to go into those professions and have not done an adequate job of creating incentives for those professionals where they are to come to remote areas of the country. we have had some of the highest need for that kind of treatment. [applause] and we have also failed in terms of reimbursement rates. we have failed to give good reimbursement rates. also it sometimes doesn't make sense for the profession to be in those areas where there are not large populations. that is a failing of the system because those are hotspots in terms of the need and demand for the services that should be provided. it is very much a priority for me. we should do something about it. looking at medicare for all, we have to tweak in that system looking up where we are creating incentives for people to live and work. my final point would be -- i could go on and on -- telemedicine. we should always realize there are bad aspects of technology and good. the bad is that, stealing our privacy and we got to deal with that, but the benefit of technology, an example of benefit is telemedicine which mental health professionals and others are agreeing is a way to get services to remote areas that otherwise don't have service providers in those places.\nright back here. [applause]\ni am a junior in college but i am also one of 10.2 undocumented immigrants not protected by dr.. -- protected by daca. [applause] my question for you is, i know like a lot of politicians speak about dreamers and how you will protected them and how they bring so much to this country but i am worried about my parents and unaccompanied minors and people who are fleeing violence in war zones and nobody talks about them. i want to know what you will do to protect them and other students like me but more important lately those who have been here for years who nobody really listens to?\nwe are listening to you, and thank you. thank you for having the courage to stand up. you are right. the issue of immigration is not a monolith, to the point of your question. there are very specific subsets under that heading that have to be addressed and understood including the young people like yourself who did not receive daca protection and are here contributing and identifying in a way that is about wanting to stay and wanting to be protected. first of all we have got to have comprehensive immigration reform. we are not -- it is not only about a goal. there is no task right now for -- no path right now for citizenship. there is no path. we have 11 million, 12 million people -- lunch time 11 million people for which there is no real path. so it is irresponsible to not come up with a plan area there has been bipartisan agreement but this administration will not sign any of them because we have a president who has created a fiction about a crisis at the border and he has held up the government and its workers around his vanity project called a wall. [applause] and it is a distraction from the real issues, and it is a distraction from the real issues. so the plan has to be, i say to you, you young leader, that we have to get our act together and we have to pass goverce of reform. the point you made of parents, students, is critically important. i was in those rooms and it was a fight to say, this is not only about we do have decided the poster child for adoration, these children have parents who love them. we should not have a policy that says, we will take care of the kids but not the parents that are raising them? that is wrong. the point also is the policy has to understand that they have parents who work hard, love them and there should be a plan for the parents. otherwise we are talking about a policy that will again separate children from parents. imagine anyone of us with our college age kids and the policy is the kid can stay in you have got to go away -- and you have got to go away? you are right to raise the subject. there must be a plan for the parents of the young people and understanding it would not be civil and it would not be something anyone of us would want which is a policy that says the kid can stay in the parents have to leave.\nwe have a question right here. [applause]\nmy name is brenda. i live in portsmouth. my husband passed away in 2017 after 12.5 years living with younger onset alzheimer's disease. my mother was diagnosed at 92 great sister was diagnosed with alzheimer's last summer. as you know, 5.7 million americans live with alzheimer's today at a cost of $277 billion. it is anticipated by 2050 we will have 14 million americans entr'acte -- entr'acte -- i understand the mental, emotional and physical toll the disease takes. lastly i would like to say when my sister is prescribed medication therapy uob be the same -- therapy, it will be the same from 23 years ago. what will you do to halt this public health crisis and devastating disease? thank you for taking my questions. [applause]\nthank you. thank you. you are amazing and thank you. [applause] that is a lot. and it is about the patient and the family to the point of your story because there is a community around this issue. there is no question that we have not done enough supporting what needs to happen around research. nih funding. this administration for example has made it one of the lowest priorities. we have to have a public health system in this country that values of the research for public health issues as opposed to research motivated by who is paying. [applause] it is a matter of research. the incentives in terms of the medication, and i have had conversations with folks about this, maybe we can follow up on your thoughts, but the lack of incentives for research around medication as it relates to alzheimer patients and really part of the issue is we are not doing enough from a public health perspective creating good government perspectives around an aging population as a general matter. to your point we are stuck in decades-old research and approaches and protocols instead of upgrading it. it is on my radar. nih is a big part of what we need to do. as a general matter what we need to do more in terms of public health policy in terms of seniors and understanding their lives are extended with health needs that are not being met because the model is based on a different range of life, frankly. i will add to that point the opioid crisis. what we are not talking about is -- i will jump into that subject, not talking about the number of seniors who are medicated and prescribed opioids to deal with the pain of aging and the addiction that is coming from that, that is not being diagnosed and treated. when we couple that with also the fact we have so many seniors who are raising and caregiving for their children's children or grandchildren because the parents of that child is addicted, and what we are doing or not doing to support those grandparents who are dealing with their own health needs and raising a generation that in previous times they would not have had to raise. there is a lot of work that we need to do as it relates to public health and seniors. i appreciate your story.\ncan we go towards the back? where is the microphone?\ni think it is a good sign you are here on presidents' day.\ni thought of that. -- i forgot about that. that is right.\ni have a comment. you were terrific on cnn. that is why we are here. first time we get to see you. how do you help americans give back -- get back to the values? you see the polls that are 80% some kind of gun control and we still have guns. what is curious to me is the senate, elected by the people, can turn their back on an 80% poll to put some kind of control in. how do you help americans? [applause] i like your saying for the people. that is how it was constructed. how do you help americans touch back to their values?\nthank you for everything you said. part of it is i believe reminding us we have more in common than what separates us and operating from that perspective, the perspective of gun violence, operating from the perspective of the mother or father that lost their child or, and this is an all too common experience, wherever that parents may be, literally thinking about and looking up bulletproof backpacks. yeah, that parent having to answer questions when the kid comes home about the drill they had in class taught them to run into a closet and be quiet and turn down their cell phone if there is a shooter in the classroom. the commonality between the parent who lost their child in the mess shooting and the mother or father who is living in a city where gun violence is the leading cause of death in black and brown men and understanding the commonality of their experience of loss of their child and bringing communities together understanding we have so much more in common than what separates us. i don't think we have lost our values. i think we need a resurgence and reminder of the fact that we all at our kitchen table in the middle of the night, we are looking at our children or grandchildren, we have the same values. it is a matter of agreeing and declaring we are operating from the same place and not buying into the idea that it is us versus them and we have nothing in common. we have to act on our values. to your point about gun violence -- you mentioned the town hall, but i will say it again. the scale -- the failure to act on gun violence is -- we can act, but let's be clear what the issue is. the issue is not that we are waiting for another tragedy like the tragedy to get everyone to do the right thing. sandy hook, 20 six and seven-year-old babies were slaughtered. we are not waiting for the next tragedy. i was in south carolina. i'm visited -- i visited mother emmanuel church where they were praying, at bible study and a gunman comes in and slaughters them. we are not waiting for another tragedy. that is not it. some people might say we are waiting for the good idea. we are not waiting for the good idea and we have had them all. universal background checks. you know what it is? it is this in its essence. you want to buy a gun? we might want to know if you have been found by a court to be a danger to your self or other people before we let you. [applause] universal background check. we might want to know if you have been convicted of a violent felony before we let you buy a gun. we are not waiting for a good idea. [applause and cheers] we are not waiting for the good idea of assault weapons ban. there is no reason to have weapons of war clogging the streets of america. [applause and cheers] assault weapons ban. [applause and cheers] so the question becomes, what are we waiting for them? what we are waiting for is members of the nra in congress have the courage to do the right thing. that is what we are waiting for. and elections matter. but you know, again, i want to stress that in all good fights, guys, they are born out of optimism. let's remember we once did have an assault weapons ban. it was not permanent obviously, so it needs to be renewed, but we have been there is my point. this is achievable, but we are going to have to fight and we cannot give up. [applause] all right, this is the last question.\nspeaking of truth telling and holidays, we have a bill in new hampshire, hb2 21, to change columbus day to indigenous peoples day. to anyone who might not feel like that is more than a superficial issue, to me as someone born and raised and went to school in new hampshire, columbus got a lot of focus and he never stepped foot on mainland north america. genocidal history aside, and we didn't get a chance to elevate voices of indigenous people here in new hampshire who are still here in new hampshire but are being erased and marginalized every day. i am wondering would you support efforts on a federal level to support changing to indigenous peoples day and why does that matter so much? [applause]\nwhy it matters is, to your point, we have to remember history. this question really is connected to the last question about morals and our compass, and/or goals and our aspirations. we have to remember our history. uncomfortable to your point about truth, though it may make us. last week -- we wrote a buddha -- a bill in my office, 200 years, couldn't get past in the united states senate. we wrote a bill to make lynching a federal crime. [applause] it finally got past. in the senate. it is still going over to the house. here is the thing. why, you ask, why? it will be the year of our lord 2019 only that this is happening. part of it is because people didn't want to deal and accept and most importantly admit that we are the scene of a crime when it comes to what we did with slavery and jim crow and institutionalized racism in this country. [applause] and we have to be honest about that. we have to be honest. [applause] we have to be honest. because if we are not honest we are not going to deal with the vestiges of all of that harm and we are not going to correct course. we will not be true to our values and morals. so similarly when it comes to indigenous americans, the people, there is a lot of work that we still have to do. i appreciate and applaud your point and effort and count me in on support. [applause]\nthank you, thank you senator kamala harris.

[applause] i want to thank all of you who are being part of a campaign which is not only going to win the democratic nomination, which is not only going to defeat donald trump who is the most dangerous president in modern american history. [applause] with your help, we are going to transform this country. and finally create an economy and a government which works for all of us not just the 1%. [applause] today, at our first rally i want to welcome you to a campaign which says loudly and clearly that the underlying principle of our government will not be greed, hatred, and lies. [applause] it will not be racism, sexism, the phobia, homophobia, and religious bigotry. it will not be tax breaks for billionaires. and efforts to throw millions off the health care that they currently have. this campaign is going to end all of that. [applause] the principles of our government will be based on justice. on economic justice. on social justice. on racial justice. on environmental justice. today, i welcome you to a campaign which tells the powerful special interests who control so much of our economic and political life that we will no longer tolerate the greed of corporate america and [indiscernible] greed which has resulted in this country having more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth. we will no longer stand idly by and allow three families to own more than the bottom half of this country. and while these families become richer, over 20% of our children live in poverty. senior citizens cannot afford their prescription drugs. we are here to tell the 1% that we will no longer tolerate 46% of all new income going to the very richest people while millions of americans are out working two or three jobs just to survive and pay the bills. today, we launch our fight for a political revolution. we say to the private health insurance companies whether you like it or not, the united states is going to join every other major country on earth and guarantee health care to all people. you can spend all the money you want against us. we will have a medicare for all single-payer. today we say to the pharmaceutical industry that you will no longer charge the american people the highest prices in the world by law for the medicine they desperately need. whether you like it or not, your greed is going to end. [applause] today, we said to walmart, to the fast food industry and to all the low-wage employers, stop paying your workers starvation wages. yes, we are going to raise the minimum wage in this country to at least $15 per hour. we are going to make it easier for workers to join unions. [applause] today, we say to the american people that we will rebuild our infrastructure, our roads and bridges and rail system. our water system, wastewater plants, and airports. when we do that, we are going to create up to 13 million decent paying jobs. today, we say to the parents in our country that you and your children deserve quality, affordable childcare. [applause] today, here at brooklyn college, we say to young people all over this country, we want you to get the best education you can. regardless of your income. good jobs require a good education. that is why we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free. and why we are going to substantially lower the outrageous level of student debt in this country. america once had the best educated workforce in the world. and we are going to make that happen again. today, we say to our senior citizens, in vermont and brooklyn and california, we know you cannot survive with dignity on $14,000 per year social security. my republican colleagues in the senate want to cut social security benefits. we have some bad news for them. we are going to raise social security benefits. climate change is our fault. it is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet. we intended to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy. when we do that, we will create millions of good paying jobs. all of us has a moral responsibility to make certain that the planet we leave our kids and our grandchildren is a planet that is healthy. today, we say to the prison industrial complex that we are going to achieve real criminal justice reform in this country. we're going to end the national embarrassment of the united states having more people in jail than any other country on earth. instead of spending $80 billion on jails and incarceration, we are going to invest in jobs and education. no more private prisons. no more profiteering from locking people up. no more war on drugs that has destroyed so many lives. no more keeping people in jail because they are too for -- 24 two afford to --too poor to afford [indiscernible] when we talk about criminal justice reform, we are going to change a system in which tens of thousands of americans every year get criminal records for possessing marijuana. [applause] but not one major wall street executive went to jail for destroying our economy in 2000 and eight. they did not go to jail, they got a trillion dollar bailout. today, we say to the american people, instead of demonizing the undocumented immigrants in this country, we are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform. and provide a path toward citizenship. we are going to provide legal status to 1.8 million young people in the daca program. and develop a humane border policy for those who seek asylum. the united states will no longer snatch babies from the arms of their mothers. today, we say to the 1% and a large profitable corporations, listen up as this applies to you. we say to the 1% and large corporations that under a bernie sanders administration, you're not going to be getting more tax breaks. quite the contrary. we are going to end your tax breaks and your loopholes. you are going to start paying your fair share. [applause] we will no longer accept the absurd situation where large multibillion dollar corporations like amazon, netflix, and general motors paid nothing in federal income taxes. we are not going to allow these corporations of the billionaires -- where the billionaires have stashed their millions in the cayman islands and are not paying taxes. yet, the wealthy and multinational corporations will start paying their fair share of taxes. today, we say to the military-industrial complex that we will not continue to spend $700 billion per year on the military, more than the top 10 nations combined. we will invest in affordable housing [applause] we will invest in public education. [applause] we will invest in our crumbling infrastructure. no more major investments in never-ending wars. [applause] brothers and sisters, we are going to win this election not because we have a super pac funded by billionaires. we are going to win this election because we are putting together the strongest grassroots campaign in the history of america. donald trump wants to divide us up. based on the color of our skin. based on where we were born. based on our gender. based on our religion or sexual orientation. what we are about is doing exactly the opposite. we are going to bring our people together. black and white, latino, asian american, native american, gay and straight, young and old, men and women, nativeborn and immigrant, we are together. together, we will transform this country. [applause] if i might take a moment as i return here to the area where i was born, let me say some personal words. as we launch this campaign for president, you deserve to know where i came from because family history heavily influences the values that we develop as adults. i was born a few miles away from here on east 26th street. my family and i lived in a three and a half room rent-controlled apartment. my father was a paint salesman who worked hard his entire life but never made it much money. my mother raised my brothers and me. i learned a great deal about immigration as a child because my father came from poland. at the age of 17, without a nickel in his pocket. he came to the united states to escape the crushing poverty that existed in his community and to escape widespread anti-semitism. it was a good thing that he came to this country. virtually his entire family was wiped out by hitler's. i am not going to tell you that i grew up in a home of desperate poverty. that was not true. coming from a lower middle-class family, i will never forget about how money or lack of money was always a point of stress in our family. my mother's dream was that someday our family would move out all that rent-controlled apartment to a home of our own. that dream was never fulfilled. she died young while we still lived in that rent-controlled apartment. my experience as a child, living in a family that struggled economically, powerfully influenced my life and my values. i know where i came from. [applause] that is something i will never forget. [applause] unlike donald trump, who shut down the government and left 800,000 veterans employees without income to pay their bills, i know what it is like to be in a family that lives paycheck to paycheck. now it is true, i did not have a father who gave me millions of dollars to build luxury skyscrapers. casinos and country clubs. i did not come from a family that gave me a $200,000 allowance every year beginning at the age of three. as i recall, my allowance was $.25 per week. i had something more valuable. i had a role model of a father who had unbelievable courage. coming across an ocean with no money in his pocket to start a new and better life. [applause] i did not come from a family of privilege that allowed me to entertain people on television by telling workers you are fired. i came from a family who knew all too well the frightening power employers can have over everyday workers. i did not come from a family that could afford to send my brother and me to an elite boarding school. in fact, i was educated proudly in high-quality public schools here in brooklyn. [applause] and began my higher education right here on this campus. i should also mention that my brother graduated from brooklyn college. i did not come from a family that taught me to build a corporate empire through housing discrimination. i protested housing discrimination. i was arrested for protesting school segregation. one of the proudest days of my life was attending the march on washington led by dr. martin luther king. brothers and sisters, over the last two years and before that, you and i and millions of americans have stood up and fought for justice in every part of our society. we had some successes. together, billionaires and large corporations have attacked --/wages. we have succeeded in raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour in states and cities all over this country. together, we thought amazon and the disney corporation to do the same. we have stood with people all across this country who went out on strike to fight for better schools for their kids. together the forces of militarism have kept us engaged in never-ending wars. we have stood together and fought back for the first time in 45 years. we have utilized the war power act to move us forward to end the horrific saudi led war in yemen. [applause] together and so many young people have received -- we have seen states decriminalized marijuana. we are beginning to see states and communities expunge the records of those arrested. [applause] have one some victories, but clearly, we have a long long way to go. i am here to tell you that because all of the work we have done together, we are on the brink of not just winning an election but transforming our country. let me tell you a little of what that means. when we are in the white house, [applause] we will enact a federal jobs guarantee to ensure that everyone in this country is guaranteed a job. there is more than enough work to be done in this country. let's get it done. [applause] when we are in the white house, we will attack the program -- problem of urban gentrification. and build the affordable housing this country desperately needs. when we are in the white house, we will end the decline of earl america. -- world america. we will reopen rural hospitals that have been closed. we will ensure that young people in rural communities have decent jobs so they can remain in the communities they love. when we are in the white house, we will end the epidemic of gun violence. [applause] we're going to pass the commonsense gun safety legislation that the overwhelming majority of americans want to see. [applause] when we are in the white house, we will dress not only the national disparity of wealth and income but the racial disparity of wealth and income. [applause] we are going to put out institutional racism wherever it exists. not only will we end the cowardly outrage -- we will make it easier for people to vote, not harder. when we are in the white house, we're going to protect a woman's right to control her own body. [applause] that distinction is a woman's decision. [applause] not the federal government, not the state government, not the local government. [applause] please make no mistake about it. the struggles that we are undertaking is not just about the donald trump. this struggle is about taking on the incredibly powerful institution that controls the economic and political life of our nation. let me be very specific. i am talking about wall street. i am talking about the insurance companies. the truck companies. the military-industrial complex. the drug companies. the prison industrial complex. the fossil fuel industry. and a corrupt campaign fice system that enables billionaires [indiscernible] brothers and sisters, [chanting bernie!) we have an enormous amount of work in front of us. it will not be easy. the wealthy and powerful elite who decade after decade have gotten everything they want will do all that they can to defend their ficial interest. and they have an unlimited amount of money at their disposal. we have something that they do not have. we have the people. [applause] this is what i believe. this is what i believe from the bottom of my heart. if we do not allow trump and his friends to divide us up, if we stand together black and white and latino, asian american, native american. if we stand together urban and rural, north south east and west . if we stand together not as red states or blue states but as working people fighting together. if we stand together believing in justice and human dignity, if we stand together believing in love and compassion. if we stand together brothers and sisters the future of this country is extraordinary and there is nothing we will not be able to accomplish. thank you all very much.

[applause] today, i want to welcome all of you to a campaign which says loudly and proudly that the underlying principles of our government will not be greed, will not be kleptocracy, will not be hatred and lies. [applause] the underlying principles of our government will not be racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia, and religious bigotry. [applause] the principles that our government will work under will be based on justice. economic justice, social justice, racial justice, and environmental justice. [applause] those are the principles that we believe in in new england and to those are the principles that will underlie our government. [applause] today, i want to welcome you to a campaign which tells the powerful special interest who control so much of the economic and political life of our country that we will no longer accept their greed, which is destroying the middle class. [applause] an unprecedented level of greed, which has resulted in our country having more income and wealth inequality today than in any time since the 1920's, and it is worse today than in any major country on earth. we are unapologetic stating that we will not stand idly by and allow three families in america to own more wealth than the bottom half of the american people. [applause] meanwhile, while the very very rich get much richer, over 20% of our children in this country live in poverty. veterans who put their lives on their line to defend us are sleeping on the street and seniors all over the country cannot afford their prescription drugs. we will no longer accept 46% of all new income going to the top 1%. [applause] 46% goes to the 1% and all over the country there were millions of people who are working two or three jobs, just to pay the bills. and over half the people in the country today are living paycheck-to-paycheck, frightened to death that if their car breaks down, they will not be able to get to work. and if they cannot get to work, they will be fired, and if they get fired, they will not be able to take care of their kids. we have people all over the country who are scared to death and worried about what happens if their kids get sick, because they do not have enough money to take the child to the doctor. we will no longer accept the situation in which, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, our younger generation will have, if we do not change it, a lower standard of living than their parents. they are earning lower wages. they go down in the world -- they go out into the world with higher debt. housing is unaffordable. they have less mobility. not to mention the fact that we are graciously leaving the younger generation with a $22 trillion national debt. i have four kids and seven grandchildren, three of them in new hampshire. it is not acceptable to me that for those kids, the projection is downward. i believe in upward mobility, not downward mobility, and that is the economy right now. [applause] but it is not just a grossly unfair economic system that we are going to deal with. it is also a corrupt political system, which is undermining american democracy. [applause] i know that this is a very radical idea, but we in new england have an old-fashioned idea that democracy is about one person per vote, not billionaires buying elections. [applause] and whether mr. trump or mitch mcconnell like it or not, we are going to overturn this disastrous system. we are going to move toward public funding of election. because i want any person in this room, any person in america who wants to run for office, no matter what their political views may be, i want them to be able to run for office regardless of their income. and i do not see them having to be dependent on big money interests running these campaigns. [applause] as this is our first event here in new hampshire in this campaign, let me offer a very special thanks to the people of new hampshire. as all of you will remember, in 2015, this is where the political revolution took off. thank you, new hampshire. [cheers and applause] when we began our campaign here in new hampshire in 2015, we were way, way behind. according to the polls. further, the ideas we were talking about then, i want you to go back to a few years ago. the ideas we were talking about then were considered by establishment politicians and mainstream media to be radical and extreme. nobody in america was going to support those ideas. remember this. raising them, wage -- raising the minimum wage to a living wage, to radical. -- too radical. guaranteeing health care to all people as a right, too radical. creating millions of jobs, too radical. aggressively combating climate change, too radical. reforming the broken criminal justice system and broken immigration system, too radical. not having to beg wealthy people for campaign contributions, too radical. ending the power of superdelegate threat -- superdelegates, too radical. [applause] well, as all of you recall, a funny thing happened in new hampshire that year. on primary day, we did not end up 30 or 40 point behind. on primary day, we won a very strong victory here in new hampshire. [cheers and applause] it was the very first victory that we won. and that victory here in new hampshire led us to win victories in 21 other state around the country -- states around the country, led us to win over 13 million votes, over 1700 delegates of the democratic convention, and most importantly, more votes from young people. black, white, asian americans, latino americans, more than donald and hillary clinton combined. -- more than donald trump and hillary clinton combined. [cheers and applause] and by the way, just thought i would mention this. those ideas we talked about when we came here four years ago our ideas that seemed so very radical at that time. today, virtually all of those ideas are supported by a majority of american people and they are being supported by democratic candidates from school board to president of the united states. so to the people of new hampshire, let me just say you helped begin the political revolution in 2015, and with your help on this campaign, we are going to complete what we started here. [cheers and applause]\nbernie, bernie, bernie.\nthank you very much. but let me say to you what i say all the time. it is not be. it is not bernie. it is us -- it is not me. it is not bernie. it is us. and as i will mention in a moment, what we talk about, it sounds like political rhetoric. but trust me, it is much deeper than that. the reality is that america today, given the incredible power that the special interests have, here is the truth. no president, no matter how decent the person may be, can do it alone. because the special interest of so much -- have so much wealth and power and influence over the media, no one president can do it all. we cannot do it with one president. we have to do it with the mass movement of millions of people standing up and fighting. [cheers and applause] so i am not talking about rhetoric. this is not about a cute slogan. this is about the fact that we need to stand together in this campaign and win the nomination and defeat trump together. but i will need your help the day after the election, the day after the inauguration. [cheers and applause] are you guys prepared to sign up for the long haul? [cheers and applause] today, as we begin our campaign here in new hampshire, we say to the private health insurance companies, whether you like it or not, the united states of america will join every other major country on earth and guarantee health cape -- and guarantee health care to all people, left and right. [applause] all americans, it does not sound like a radical idea to me, but we have to say it. all americans are entitled to go to the doctor when you are sick and not have to worry about outrageous deductibles or co-pays or the fact that you might not have insurance. and all of you are entitled to know that if you end up in the hospital with a serious illness, your family does not have to go bankrupt in order to pay the hospital bill. [cheers and applause] there is going to be a whole lot of debate about health care. i know the insurance companies and drug companies will be spending hundreds of millions of dollars to protect their profit and power. but as a nation, the american people are catching on. we will no longer accept the absurdity of paying almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country. [applause] while at the same time we have a lower life expectancy and worse health care outcomes than many other countries. we are spending a fortune on health care but getting relatively little back. are you ready for a radical idea? the goal of health care should be to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way, not to allow the insurance companies to make tens of millions of dollars in profits. [applause] let me tell you what you will not see on tv and the insurance company adds. in 2017, remember, 30 million people, no health insurance. in the midst of that, in 2017, the top 65 health care ceo's made $1.7 billion in compensation. children cannot afford to go to the doctor, but the ceo of unitedhealth group made $83 million in compensation. we need a health care system that invests in disease prevention, that invests in doctors, nurses, dentists, clinics, so that everybody in the country has access to a doctor or dentist. [applause] we do not need a health care system which allows insurance companies to make billions of dollars in profits and the ceos of the company's to make outlandish compensation packages. so we say to the insurance companies, your day is coming. yes, we are going to pass a medicare for all single-payer program. [cheering] i want to say a word to senior citizens on medicare right now. trump and his friends are saying medicare is a lower quality of health care for seniors. i know i will shock you when i say this. donald trump is lying. i know, i have to say that. here is the truth. medicare is a very strong program. a very popular program for seniors. but it has caps. it does not cover dental care, eyeglasses, hearing aids. our medicare for all will cover dental care, eyeglasses, and hearing aids. [applause] and when we talk about health care, it is imperative that we talk about prescription drugs and the pharmaceutical industry. our message to them is simple. we will no longer allow them to rip off the american people and charge us by far the highest prices in the world for the medicines we need. back when i was a congressman in 1999, we took a bus load of seniors, not seniors, of working-class women, many of whom were struggling with breast cancer. we went over the canadian border into montreal from new hampshire. we walked in to a pharmacy in montreal and the women were able to purchase the widely prescribed breast cancer drug for 1/10 of the price they were paying in the united states. i will never forget these were working-class women struggling for their lives. tease -- tears were coming out of their eyes as they were able to purchase the medicine for 10% of what they would have paid. for the other countries in the world, the same exact drug is sold. here it is sold for far higher prices. last year, the drug companies made $50 billion in profits. we say to the drug companies that elderly people are not going to have to cut their pills in half. we will not tolerate a situation where one out of five americans cannot afford to fill the prescriptions of their doctors. can you imagine how insane that is? and drug companies, that is going to lower the prices of drugs. today, we say to walmart and the fast food industry, well, that is one way you could say it. [laughter] i am a senator so i can't say it like that. but what we will say is, start paying your employees a living wage. i am sick and tired of meeting workers all over this country who are trying to get by on eight dollars, nine dollars, 10 dollars per hour. the truth is, nobody can do that. you can't what a roof over your head, you can't buy food or take care of your kids, you can't do it. that is why so many people are working 50, 60, 70 hours per week. in my view, there is a simple proposition i believe, and that is anybody in this country who works 40 hours per week should not be living in poverty. [applause] so yes, we say to walmart and the other low-wage employers, we are going to raise the minimum wage in this country from $7.25 per hour to a living wage emma $15 per hour. [applause] i want to take a moment to share with you the kind of progress that we are making. four years ago when i was here in new hampshire and we talked about the idea of a $15 per hour minimum wage, it seemed like an impossible dream because we were more than doubling the federal minimum wage. since then, i am proud to tell you that five states in this country have already passed legislation to raise the minimum wage. [applause] and just last week, just last week, legislation i offered in the senate and the house, the house committee and let -- on labor and education reported a bill that will raise that the nevada -- the federal minimum wage to $15. that bill will pass the house in the next few weeks. [applause] it will pass the house, and we will have a struggle in the senate. do everything you can, your friends all over this country, working people can no longer work for starvation wages. we are going to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. by the way, in addition to the federal government to getting to move, some of you may know that we put enough pressure on amazon and disney so they have now raised their minimum wage to at least $15 per hour. [applause] there is an issue out there that doesn't get anywhere near the attention it deserves, and that is that you know and i know, and every psychologist who studies the issue understands, that the most important time of a human being's life are zero through 4. that is when human beings develop election really -- intellectually and emotionally. throughout this country, we have a dysfunctional child care system which is unfair to the children and unfair to their parents. so today, we stand before you and say that we will pass universal affordable childcare in this country. [applause] [cheering] today, we say to our young people that we want you to get the best education that you can, regardless of the income of your family. [applause] we live in a competitive global economy. we used to have the best educated workforce in the world. that is no longer the case. and that is why today, i state what i stated your four years ago. we are making progress on this issue. we are going to make public colleges and universities' tuition free. [applause] how many of you here today are dealing with student debt? we have a substantially -- we have to substantially lower that student debt. and today, we say to our senior citizens, 20% of whom are trying to get by on social security benefits of $13,500 or less, think for a moment. in the richest country in the history of the world, where we see a proliferation of billionaires, you have millions of seniors trying to get by on incredibly small amounts of money. my republican colleagues in the congress want to cut social security. we have some bad news for them. we are going to expand social security benefits, not cut them. [cheering] today, we say to donald trump and the fossil fuel industry, stop lying. climate change is not a hoax. [cheering] it is an existential threat to the future of our country and the entire planet. and whether the fossil fuel industry likes it or not, we will transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. [cheering] [applause] and when we do that, when we do that, when we transform our energy system and we transform our sustainable energy, we create more sustainable energy, when we weather rise -- whether -- weatherize our homes and businesses, we will create millions of good paying jobs. we have a moral responsibility. this is a profound issue, but we have a moral responsibility to make certain that the planet we leave to our children and grandchildren is healthy and habitable, and we together will do just that. [cheers and applause] today, we say to the prison industrial complex, that we in fact are going to bring about real criminal justice reform. [cheers and applause] this is america. we should not the having more people in jail than any other country on earth. we should not be spending $80 billion per year locking up fellow americans. we intend to invest in our young people in jobs and education, not jail and incarceration. [cheers and applause] no more private prisons and detention centers. and we are finally going to end the war on drugs, which has destroyed so many lives. [cheers and applause] no more keeping people, and i didn't know this until the -- a few years ago, right now as we speak, there are hundreds of thousands of people in jail in this country. you know why? because they are poor and can't afford cash bail. we are going to and cash bail in this country. -- going to end cash bail in this country. by the way, when we talk about criminal justice reform, we are going to change a system in which tens of thousands of americans every single year get criminal records because of possession of marijuana. but, and i want you to think about this, this is how corrupt that system is. you have a criminal record if you are caught with marijuana, but not one major wall street executive went to jail, despite their illegal behavior in destroying our economy in 2008. [cheers and applause] now, they didn't go to jail. they got a one trillion dollar bailout. that is going to change. we believe in equal justice under the law. today, we say that instead of demonizing the undocumented immigrants in this country, we are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship. [cheers and applause] we are going to provide legal status to the 1.8 million young people eligible for the daca program. and develop a humane border policy for those who seek asylum. america must never be about snatching babies from the arms of their mothers. [cheers and applause] today, we say to the top 1%, who have never had it so good, and the large corporations who are enjoying record-breaking profits , that under a bernie sanders administration, we are going to end the massive tax breaks and loopholes that you currently enjoy. [cheers and applause] anybody, all of you know that amazon is one of the large, largest corporations in america owned by the wealthiest person in the world that made over $10 billion in profits. does anybody know how much amazon paid in taxes? you paid more than amazon did. we will end a system that allows the wealthy and large corporations to stash zillions of dollars in the cayman islands and other. we will no longer accept those tax breaks. we will demand that the wealthiest people and largest corporations start paying their fair share of taxes. [cheers and applause] we are going to end austerity for working families and bring some austerity to the 1% and large multinationals. [cheers and applause] today, we say to the military-industrial complex that we will not continue to spend $700 billion per year on the military, more than the top 10 nations combined. we are going to invest in affordable housing, we are going to invest in public education, we are not going to end a new to invest -- continue to invest in never-ending wars. [cheers and applause] my friends, we are going to win this election. [cheers and applause] not it has -- not because we have a super pac funded by billionaires. we are going to win this election because we will put together the strongest grassroots coalition in the history of american politics. [cheers and applause] donald trump wants to divide our people up. based on the color of our skin, our country of origin, our gender, our religion, our sexual orientation. we are going to do exactly the opposite. we are going to bring our people together, black and white and latino, native american asian-american, gay and straight, young and old, men and women, nativeborn and immigrant. [cheers and applause] we are going to bring our people together for an unprecedented grassroots campaign. let me mention this to you, the media talk a lot about something that is true and i am proud of, in the first week of the campaign we raised a lot of money through small, individual donations. let me thank everybody -- [cheers and applause] bernie sanders.com. ok, that's it. and i am proud of that. that is how we raised our money. it used to be $27, it went down to $26. we are proud of that. i will tell you what i am even prouder of. in the last couple weeks, we have signed up over 1.1 million people who are prepared to roll up their sleeves and get to work on this grassroots campaign. and i want to thank all of you. [cheers and applause] as all of you know, we in new england have a heritage that we are very proud of, and has influenced our way of being. i am not talking about the patriots. that is the concept of town meetings. this is a tradition that has been going on in new england for hundreds of years, and it is something that i take very, very seriously, because town meetings mean to me people coming together in a community and arguing about how much they are going to spend on education, how much they will spend on the roads, people treat each other with respect. doesn't matter how much money you have, doesn't matter where in town you live. you got one vote per perverts and -- per person. the essence of democracy is about that. it gives me no pleasure to tell you that in america today under president trump, the very concept, it is hard to imagine but the very concept of democracy is under attack by a president who seems intent on emulating the authoritarian leaders in russia, china, saudi arabia, north korea, and elsewhere that he seems to have so much affection for. as many of you know, all over this world today, there is a great struggle taking place between a growing authority at -- authoritarianism and democracy. trump is consistency on -- consistently on the wrong side of that struggle. time and time again, he has words of praise and affection for those leaders who despise democracy while picking fights with our long time democratic allies. democracy is about serious debate over public policy, not having a president who is a pathological liar and has told thousands of latent lies since he has been in office. -- blatant lies since he has been in office. i don't care, people in a democracy have different points of view and all of us have conservative friends. we have debates. it is not acceptable to me, and i think not acceptable to the vast majority of it -- of the american people, that we have a president who doesn't know the difference between truth and lies. [applause] democracy is about understanding that in a free society with a free media, political leaders will always get criticized. it is beyond disgraceful that our president refers to the american media as enemies of the people. this is what demagogues always do. rather than accept responsibility for what they do, they claim that what anyone is saying about them is a lie. at a time when reporters around the world are literally being killed because of the work they are doing, trump is intentionally intimidating the press in the united states. in fact, he even praised a congressman who physically assaulted a journalist during a campaign in montana. [crowd booing] edit time when we should be in courage and more people to get involved in the political process, and increase voter turnout, trump and his administration are actively involved in voter suppression. his justice department supported purging voters from the rolls in ohio and a supreme court appointee cast the deciding vote to uphold that move. in a major effort to increase voter suppression, trump consistently lied about the extent of voter fraud in this country and put together a short-lived commission on voter fraud that was eventually laughed out of existence. trump told the world very clearly how he feels about democracy and dissent. when he refused to criticize saudi arabia after the despotic regime murdered a journalist in cold blood. [applause] one of our tasks, and i say this to people who disagree with me politically, our conservative wrens, what all of us should be involved in is strengthening our democracy. all of us should try to create a situation where it becomes easier for people to vote, not harder for people to vote. [cheers and applause] and as we engage in serious political debate and we listen to each other's points of view, all of us, conservative, moderate, progressive, should condemn a president who consistently lies. [applause] now, during this campaign, i have the feeling that here in new hampshire, you are going to see a lot of candidates come before you. that is a great thing. i want to tell you, i know many of these democratic candidates and many of them are my fellow sedatives -- senators. many of them are my friends. without exception they are good people. what i hope very much and i believe will happen is that we understand that our job as candidates is not to tear each other down, but have a serious discussion about our views and what we would do as president, and also to understand that at the end of this primary contest, no matter who wins, and i certainly hope it will be me, we will rally together and defeat donald trump. [cheers and applause] now, a lot of folks are going to come through new hampshire. they will tell you what they are going to do, and let me be as clear as i can be. in telling you what my goals are. when we, and i use the word we, when we are in the white house, we will an act a federal jobs guarantee to ensure that everyone who is able to work is guaranteed a stable job. there is, as all of you know, there is so much work to be done in america, whether it is rebuilding our infrastructure, dealing with climate change, dealing with child care, taking care of the elderly. we will need more workers in health care. there is enough work to do. let's put people to work doing that. [cheers and applause] vermont is one of the most rural states in this country, as is new hampshire. when we are in the white house, we will not only and the decline of rural america. i don't want to see kids being forced to leave the small towns they love and grew up in because there are no jobs and there is no decent health care. we will rebuild rural america. [cheers and applause] and we understand that in rural america called -- all across this country, instead of creating good jobs and good health care, what we are seeing is an epidemic of despair. we are seeing a massive amount of depression, we are seeing a very high rate of suicide, and we are seeing, in new hampshire and around the country, far too much opioid addiction. our job is to give hope to people and end that despair. [cheers and applause] when we are in the white house, we will move aggressively to end the epidemic of gun violence in this country. [cheers and applause] and pass commonsense gun safety legislation that the overwhelming majority of americans want. when we are in the white house, we are going to address not only the national disparities of income and wealth, but the racial disparities as well. [cheers and applause] we are going to root out institutional racism wherever it exists. [cheers and applause] and not only are we going to end voter suppression, we are going to make it easier for people to vote. it is not a radical idea to say that if you are 18 years of age in this country and a citizen, you have the right to vote, and of discussion. -- end of discussion. [cheers and applause] when we are in the white house, we are going to protect a woman's right to control her own body. [cheers and applause] that is a decision for women all across this country, not the federal government, not the state government, not the local government, but a woman's decision. [cheers and applause] make no mistake about it, the struggle we are engaging in is not just about defeating donald trump. the struggle is about taking on the incredibly powerful institutions that control economic and political life of this country, and i am talking about wall street. if you think we are going to get affordable loans to small businesses, you are going to have to deal with wall street and start breaking up these huge banks. [cheers and applause] if you think we are going to get medicare for all, we will have to take on the insurance companies. if you think we are going to lower drug prices in this country, we are going to have to take on the pharmaceutical industry. if you think we are going to end never-ending wars and lower military spending, we are going to have to take on the military-industrial complex. if you think we are going to protect family-based agriculture, and organic agriculture in this country, you are going to have to take on agribusiness like monsanto. if we are going to bring about criminal justice reform, we are going to have to take on the prison industrial complex. [cheers and applause] now, i say that just to give you an idea how hard the struggle is. it is not a question of someone coming before you and wanting to do the right thing. it is somebody coming before you and understanding that we need millions of people to take these folks on who have unlimited amounts of money. you're going to see the 32nd ads all over the state. they have the money, they have the power, but we have something together that they do not have. we have the people. [cheers and applause] and they understand that. you know, there is a simple arithmetic facts. when we talk about the 1%, they are 1%. we are the 99%. [cheers and applause] if we stand together, and by the way, the political tactic is what demagogues always do. they understand when ory -- when ordinary people, what do they want? health care, good jobs, they want good education for their kids, they want to be able to drink good water and breathe clean air. they don't want war. that is what people want. these guys win elections by dividing us up. somebody over there was a different color? somebody over there is a different sexual orientation? somebody came from mexico? somebody over there is gay? our job is to stand up to trump, and not let him divide us up. [cheers and applause] and if we stand together, as black and white and latino and asian and native american, if we stand together as gay and straight, men and women, nativeborn and immigrant, if we stand together as rural and urban, north, south, east and west, if we understand the important reality that there is no such thing as a red state or a blue state, the truth is, there are 50 states in this country. in every single one of those states, working people are struggling hard to take care of their families. that is the reality of america. [cheers and applause] brothers and sisters, i am here today to ask for your help in winning the democratic nomination, and uniting our party and our people to defeat trump. but i am also asking your help to stand together so that we can create an economy and a government that works for all of us. and when we do that, when we stand together, the future of this country is enormously great and i am very optimistic. let us stand together, let us go forward. thank you all very much. [cheers and applause]\nsinging] (music) powered to the people, power to the people (music) (music) power to the people (music) (music)\nduring this year's conservative political action conference, also known as cpac, we asked attendees what does it mean to be american?", "group_name": "Sanders", "color": "#FF2311", "group_id": 1, "name": "Concord, NH"}, "geometry": {"coordinates": [-71.5375718, 43.2081366], "type": "Point"}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"headline": "2019-03-10 || Sanders || Keene, NH", "month": "March", "article": "Keene, NH thank you all. thank you. i know we new englanders are hardy souls, -- heartt souls, but i did not expect to see so many people here today. thank you so much. where is richard? you are here. we have a lot to talk about. we are living in an extraordinary moment in american history. we are living in an unprecedented moment, which is why we need an unprecedented campaign. thank you all very much for being here and being part of that campaign. let me be very clear. this campaign is not only going to win the democratic nomination , this campaign is not only going to defeat donald trump, the most dangerous president in american history, but, with your help, this campaign is going to transform our country and finally, finally, create an economy and government which works for all of us, not just the 1%. [applause] today, i want to welcome all of you to a campaign which says loudly and proudly that the underlying principles of our government will not be greed, will not be kleptocracy, will not be hatred and lies. [applause] the underlying principles of our government will not be racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia, and religious bigotry. [applause] the principles that our government will work under will be based on justice. economic justice, social justice, racial justice, and environmental justice. [applause] those are the principles that we believe in in new england and to those are the principles that will underlie our government. [applause] today, i want to welcome you to a campaign which tells the powerful special interest who control so much of the economic and political life of our country that we will no longer accept their greed, which is destroying the middle class. [applause] an unprecedented level of greed, which has resulted in our country having more income and wealth inequality today than in any time since the 1920's, and it is worse today than in any major country on earth. we are unapologetic stating that we will not stand idly by and allow three families in america to own more wealth than the bottom half of the american people. [applause] meanwhile, while the very very rich get much richer, over 20% of our children in this country live in poverty. veterans who put their lives on their line to defend us are sleeping on the street and seniors all over the country cannot afford their prescription drugs. we will no longer accept 46% of all new income going to the top 1%. [applause] 46% goes to the 1% and all over the country there were millions of people who are working two or three jobs, just to pay the bills. and over half the people in the country today are living paycheck-to-paycheck, frightened to death that if their car breaks down, they will not be able to get to work. and if they cannot get to work, they will be fired, and if they get fired, they will not be able to take care of their kids. we have people all over the country who are scared to death and worried about what happens if their kids get sick, because they do not have enough money to take the child to the doctor. we will no longer accept the situation in which, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, our younger generation will have, if we do not change it, a lower standard of living than their parents. they are earning lower wages. they go down in the world -- they go out into the world with higher debt. housing is unaffordable. they have less mobility. not to mention the fact that we are graciously leaving the younger generation with a $22 trillion national debt. i have four kids and seven grandchildren, three of them in new hampshire. it is not acceptable to me that for those kids, the projection is downward. i believe in upward mobility, not downward mobility, and that is the economy right now. [applause] but it is not just a grossly unfair economic system that we are going to deal with. it is also a corrupt political system, which is undermining american democracy. [applause] i know that this is a very radical idea, but we in new england have an old-fashioned idea that democracy is about one person per vote, not billionaires buying elections. [applause] and whether mr. trump or mitch mcconnell like it or not, we are going to overturn this disastrous system. we are going to move toward public funding of election. because i want any person in this room, any person in america who wants to run for office, no matter what their political views may be, i want them to be able to run for office regardless of their income. and i do not see them having to be dependent on big money interests running these campaigns. [applause] as this is our first event here in new hampshire in this campaign, let me offer a very special thanks to the people of new hampshire. as all of you will remember, in 2015, this is where the political revolution took off. thank you, new hampshire. [cheers and applause] when we began our campaign here in new hampshire in 2015, we were way, way behind. according to the polls. further, the ideas we were talking about then, i want you to go back to a few years ago. the ideas we were talking about then were considered by establishment politicians and mainstream media to be radical and extreme. nobody in america was going to support those ideas. remember this. raising them, wage -- raising the minimum wage to a living wage, to radical. -- too radical. guaranteeing health care to all people as a right, too radical. creating millions of jobs, too radical. aggressively combating climate change, too radical. reforming the broken criminal justice system and broken immigration system, too radical. not having to beg wealthy people for campaign contributions, too radical. ending the power of superdelegate threat -- superdelegates, too radical. [applause] well, as all of you recall, a funny thing happened in new hampshire that year. on primary day, we did not end up 30 or 40 point behind. on primary day, we won a very strong victory here in new hampshire. [cheers and applause] it was the very first victory that we won. and that victory here in new hampshire led us to win victories in 21 other state around the country -- states around the country, led us to win over 13 million votes, over 1700 delegates of the democratic convention, and most importantly, more votes from young people. black, white, asian americans, latino americans, more than donald and hillary clinton combined. -- more than donald trump and hillary clinton combined. [cheers and applause] and by the way, just thought i would mention this. those ideas we talked about when we came here four years ago our ideas that seemed so very radical at that time. today, virtually all of those ideas are supported by a majority of american people and they are being supported by democratic candidates from school board to president of the united states. so to the people of new hampshire, let me just say you helped begin the political revolution in 2015, and with your help on this campaign, we are going to complete what we started here. [cheers and applause]\nbernie, bernie, bernie.\nthank you very much. but let me say to you what i say all the time. it is not be. it is not bernie. it is us -- it is not me. it is not bernie. it is us. and as i will mention in a moment, what we talk about, it sounds like political rhetoric. but trust me, it is much deeper than that. the reality is that america today, given the incredible power that the special interests have, here is the truth. no president, no matter how decent the person may be, can do it alone. because the special interest of so much -- have so much wealth and power and influence over the media, no one president can do it all. we cannot do it with one president. we have to do it with the mass movement of millions of people standing up and fighting. [cheers and applause] so i am not talking about rhetoric. this is not about a cute slogan. this is about the fact that we need to stand together in this campaign and win the nomination and defeat trump together. but i will need your help the day after the election, the day after the inauguration. [cheers and applause] are you guys prepared to sign up for the long haul? [cheers and applause] today, as we begin our campaign here in new hampshire, we say to the private health insurance companies, whether you like it or not, the united states of america will join every other major country on earth and guarantee health cape -- and guarantee health care to all people, left and right. [applause] all americans, it does not sound like a radical idea to me, but we have to say it. all americans are entitled to go to the doctor when you are sick and not have to worry about outrageous deductibles or co-pays or the fact that you might not have insurance. and all of you are entitled to know that if you end up in the hospital with a serious illness, your family does not have to go bankrupt in order to pay the hospital bill. [cheers and applause] there is going to be a whole lot of debate about health care. i know the insurance companies and drug companies will be spending hundreds of millions of dollars to protect their profit and power. but as a nation, the american people are catching on. we will no longer accept the absurdity of paying almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country. [applause] while at the same time we have a lower life expectancy and worse health care outcomes than many other countries. we are spending a fortune on health care but getting relatively little back. are you ready for a radical idea? the goal of health care should be to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way, not to allow the insurance companies to make tens of millions of dollars in profits. [applause] let me tell you what you will not see on tv and the insurance company adds. in 2017, remember, 30 million people, no health insurance. in the midst of that, in 2017, the top 65 health care ceo's made $1.7 billion in compensation. children cannot afford to go to the doctor, but the ceo of unitedhealth group made $83 million in compensation. we need a health care system that invests in disease prevention, that invests in doctors, nurses, dentists, clinics, so that everybody in the country has access to a doctor or dentist. [applause] we do not need a health care system which allows insurance companies to make billions of dollars in profits and the ceos of the company's to make outlandish compensation packages. so we say to the insurance companies, your day is coming. yes, we are going to pass a medicare for all single-payer program. [cheering] i want to say a word to senior citizens on medicare right now. trump and his friends are saying medicare is a lower quality of health care for seniors. i know i will shock you when i say this. donald trump is lying. i know, i have to say that. here is the truth. medicare is a very strong program. a very popular program for seniors. but it has caps. it does not cover dental care, eyeglasses, hearing aids. our medicare for all will cover dental care, eyeglasses, and hearing aids. [applause] and when we talk about health care, it is imperative that we talk about prescription drugs and the pharmaceutical industry. our message to them is simple. we will no longer allow them to rip off the american people and charge us by far the highest prices in the world for the medicines we need. back when i was a congressman in 1999, we took a bus load of seniors, not seniors, of working-class women, many of whom were struggling with breast cancer. we went over the canadian border into montreal from new hampshire. we walked in to a pharmacy in montreal and the women were able to purchase the widely prescribed breast cancer drug for 1/10 of the price they were paying in the united states. i will never forget these were working-class women struggling for their lives. tease -- tears were coming out of their eyes as they were able to purchase the medicine for 10% of what they would have paid. for the other countries in the world, the same exact drug is sold. here it is sold for far higher prices. last year, the drug companies made $50 billion in profits. we say to the drug companies that elderly people are not going to have to cut their pills in half. we will not tolerate a situation where one out of five americans cannot afford to fill the prescriptions of their doctors. can you imagine how insane that is? and drug companies, that is going to lower the prices of drugs. today, we say to walmart and the fast food industry, well, that is one way you could say it. [laughter] i am a senator so i can't say it like that. but what we will say is, start paying your employees a living wage. i am sick and tired of meeting workers all over this country who are trying to get by on eight dollars, nine dollars, 10 dollars per hour. the truth is, nobody can do that. you can't what a roof over your head, you can't buy food or take care of your kids, you can't do it. that is why so many people are working 50, 60, 70 hours per week. in my view, there is a simple proposition i believe, and that is anybody in this country who works 40 hours per week should not be living in poverty. [applause] so yes, we say to walmart and the other low-wage employers, we are going to raise the minimum wage in this country from $7.25 per hour to a living wage emma $15 per hour. [applause] i want to take a moment to share with you the kind of progress that we are making. four years ago when i was here in new hampshire and we talked about the idea of a $15 per hour minimum wage, it seemed like an impossible dream because we were more than doubling the federal minimum wage. since then, i am proud to tell you that five states in this country have already passed legislation to raise the minimum wage. [applause] and just last week, just last week, legislation i offered in the senate and the house, the house committee and let -- on labor and education reported a bill that will raise that the nevada -- the federal minimum wage to $15. that bill will pass the house in the next few weeks. [applause] it will pass the house, and we will have a struggle in the senate. do everything you can, your friends all over this country, working people can no longer work for starvation wages. we are going to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. by the way, in addition to the federal government to getting to move, some of you may know that we put enough pressure on amazon and disney so they have now raised their minimum wage to at least $15 per hour. [applause] there is an issue out there that doesn't get anywhere near the attention it deserves, and that is that you know and i know, and every psychologist who studies the issue understands, that the most important time of a human being's life are zero through 4. that is when human beings develop election really -- intellectually and emotionally. throughout this country, we have a dysfunctional child care system which is unfair to the children and unfair to their parents. so today, we stand before you and say that we will pass universal affordable childcare in this country. [applause] [cheering] today, we say to our young people that we want you to get the best education that you can, regardless of the income of your family. [applause] we live in a competitive global economy. we used to have the best educated workforce in the world. that is no longer the case. and that is why today, i state what i stated your four years ago. we are making progress on this issue. we are going to make public colleges and universities' tuition free. [applause] how many of you here today are dealing with student debt? we have a substantially -- we have to substantially lower that student debt. and today, we say to our senior citizens, 20% of whom are trying to get by on social security benefits of $13,500 or less, think for a moment. in the richest country in the history of the world, where we see a proliferation of billionaires, you have millions of seniors trying to get by on incredibly small amounts of money. my republican colleagues in the congress want to cut social security. we have some bad news for them. we are going to expand social security benefits, not cut them. [cheering] today, we say to donald trump and the fossil fuel industry, stop lying. climate change is not a hoax. [cheering] it is an existential threat to the future of our country and the entire planet. and whether the fossil fuel industry likes it or not, we will transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. [cheering] [applause] and when we do that, when we do that, when we transform our energy system and we transform our sustainable energy, we create more sustainable energy, when we weather rise -- whether -- weatherize our homes and businesses, we will create millions of good paying jobs. we have a moral responsibility. this is a profound issue, but we have a moral responsibility to make certain that the planet we leave to our children and grandchildren is healthy and habitable, and we together will do just that. [cheers and applause] today, we say to the prison industrial complex, that we in fact are going to bring about real criminal justice reform. [cheers and applause] this is america. we should not the having more people in jail than any other country on earth. we should not be spending $80 billion per year locking up fellow americans. we intend to invest in our young people in jobs and education, not jail and incarceration. [cheers and applause] no more private prisons and detention centers. and we are finally going to end the war on drugs, which has destroyed so many lives. [cheers and applause] no more keeping people, and i didn't know this until the -- a few years ago, right now as we speak, there are hundreds of thousands of people in jail in this country. you know why? because they are poor and can't afford cash bail. we are going to and cash bail in this country. -- going to end cash bail in this country. by the way, when we talk about criminal justice reform, we are going to change a system in which tens of thousands of americans every single year get criminal records because of possession of marijuana. but, and i want you to think about this, this is how corrupt that system is. you have a criminal record if you are caught with marijuana, but not one major wall street executive went to jail, despite their illegal behavior in destroying our economy in 2008. [cheers and applause] now, they didn't go to jail. they got a one trillion dollar bailout. that is going to change. we believe in equal justice under the law. today, we say that instead of demonizing the undocumented immigrants in this country, we are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship. [cheers and applause] we are going to provide legal status to the 1.8 million young people eligible for the daca program. and develop a humane border policy for those who seek asylum. america must never be about snatching babies from the arms of their mothers. [cheers and applause] today, we say to the top 1%, who have never had it so good, and the large corporations who are enjoying record-breaking profits , that under a bernie sanders administration, we are going to end the massive tax breaks and loopholes that you currently enjoy. [cheers and applause] anybody, all of you know that amazon is one of the large, largest corporations in america owned by the wealthiest person in the world that made over $10 billion in profits. does anybody know how much amazon paid in taxes? you paid more than amazon did. we will end a system that allows the wealthy and large corporations to stash zillions of dollars in the cayman islands and other. we will no longer accept those tax breaks. we will demand that the wealthiest people and largest corporations start paying their fair share of taxes. [cheers and applause] we are going to end austerity for working families and bring some austerity to the 1% and large multinationals. [cheers and applause] today, we say to the military-industrial complex that we will not continue to spend $700 billion per year on the military, more than the top 10 nations combined. we are going to invest in affordable housing, we are going to invest in public education, we are not going to end a new to invest -- continue to invest in never-ending wars. [cheers and applause] my friends, we are going to win this election. [cheers and applause] not it has -- not because we have a super pac funded by billionaires. we are going to win this election because we will put together the strongest grassroots coalition in the history of american politics. [cheers and applause] donald trump wants to divide our people up. based on the color of our skin, our country of origin, our gender, our religion, our sexual orientation. we are going to do exactly the opposite. we are going to bring our people together, black and white and latino, native american asian-american, gay and straight, young and old, men and women, nativeborn and immigrant. [cheers and applause] we are going to bring our people together for an unprecedented grassroots campaign. let me mention this to you, the media talk a lot about something that is true and i am proud of, in the first week of the campaign we raised a lot of money through small, individual donations. let me thank everybody -- [cheers and applause] bernie sanders.com. ok, that's it. and i am proud of that. that is how we raised our money. it used to be $27, it went down to $26. we are proud of that. i will tell you what i am even prouder of. in the last couple weeks, we have signed up over 1.1 million people who are prepared to roll up their sleeves and get to work on this grassroots campaign. and i want to thank all of you. [cheers and applause] as all of you know, we in new england have a heritage that we are very proud of, and has influenced our way of being. i am not talking about the patriots. that is the concept of town meetings. this is a tradition that has been going on in new england for hundreds of years, and it is something that i take very, very seriously, because town meetings mean to me people coming together in a community and arguing about how much they are going to spend on education, how much they will spend on the roads, people treat each other with respect. doesn't matter how much money you have, doesn't matter where in town you live. you got one vote per perverts and -- per person. the essence of democracy is about that. it gives me no pleasure to tell you that in america today under president trump, the very concept, it is hard to imagine but the very concept of democracy is under attack by a president who seems intent on emulating the authoritarian leaders in russia, china, saudi arabia, north korea, and elsewhere that he seems to have so much affection for. as many of you know, all over this world today, there is a great struggle taking place between a growing authority at -- authoritarianism and democracy. trump is consistency on -- consistently on the wrong side of that struggle. time and time again, he has words of praise and affection for those leaders who despise democracy while picking fights with our long time democratic allies. democracy is about serious debate over public policy, not having a president who is a pathological liar and has told thousands of latent lies since he has been in office. -- blatant lies since he has been in office. i don't care, people in a democracy have different points of view and all of us have conservative friends. we have debates. it is not acceptable to me, and i think not acceptable to the vast majority of it -- of the american people, that we have a president who doesn't know the difference between truth and lies. [applause] democracy is about understanding that in a free society with a free media, political leaders will always get criticized. it is beyond disgraceful that our president refers to the american media as enemies of the people. this is what demagogues always do. rather than accept responsibility for what they do, they claim that what anyone is saying about them is a lie. at a time when reporters around the world are literally being killed because of the work they are doing, trump is intentionally intimidating the press in the united states. in fact, he even praised a congressman who physically assaulted a journalist during a campaign in montana. [crowd booing] edit time when we should be in courage and more people to get involved in the political process, and increase voter turnout, trump and his administration are actively involved in voter suppression. his justice department supported purging voters from the rolls in ohio and a supreme court appointee cast the deciding vote to uphold that move. in a major effort to increase voter suppression, trump consistently lied about the extent of voter fraud in this country and put together a short-lived commission on voter fraud that was eventually laughed out of existence. trump told the world very clearly how he feels about democracy and dissent. when he refused to criticize saudi arabia after the despotic regime murdered a journalist in cold blood. [applause] one of our tasks, and i say this to people who disagree with me politically, our conservative wrens, what all of us should be involved in is strengthening our democracy. all of us should try to create a situation where it becomes easier for people to vote, not harder for people to vote. [cheers and applause] and as we engage in serious political debate and we listen to each other's points of view, all of us, conservative, moderate, progressive, should condemn a president who consistently lies. [applause] now, during this campaign, i have the feeling that here in new hampshire, you are going to see a lot of candidates come before you. that is a great thing. i want to tell you, i know many of these democratic candidates and many of them are my fellow sedatives -- senators. many of them are my friends. without exception they are good people. what i hope very much and i believe will happen is that we understand that our job as candidates is not to tear each other down, but have a serious discussion about our views and what we would do as president, and also to understand that at the end of this primary contest, no matter who wins, and i certainly hope it will be me, we will rally together and defeat donald trump. [cheers and applause] now, a lot of folks are going to come through new hampshire. they will tell you what they are going to do, and let me be as clear as i can be. in telling you what my goals are. when we, and i use the word we, when we are in the white house, we will an act a federal jobs guarantee to ensure that everyone who is able to work is guaranteed a stable job. there is, as all of you know, there is so much work to be done in america, whether it is rebuilding our infrastructure, dealing with climate change, dealing with child care, taking care of the elderly. we will need more workers in health care. there is enough work to do. let's put people to work doing that. [cheers and applause] vermont is one of the most rural states in this country, as is new hampshire. when we are in the white house, we will not only and the decline of rural america. i don't want to see kids being forced to leave the small towns they love and grew up in because there are no jobs and there is no decent health care. we will rebuild rural america. [cheers and applause] and we understand that in rural america called -- all across this country, instead of creating good jobs and good health care, what we are seeing is an epidemic of despair. we are seeing a massive amount of depression, we are seeing a very high rate of suicide, and we are seeing, in new hampshire and around the country, far too much opioid addiction. our job is to give hope to people and end that despair. [cheers and applause] when we are in the white house, we will move aggressively to end the epidemic of gun violence in this country. [cheers and applause] and pass commonsense gun safety legislation that the overwhelming majority of americans want. when we are in the white house, we are going to address not only the national disparities of income and wealth, but the racial disparities as well. [cheers and applause] we are going to root out institutional racism wherever it exists. [cheers and applause] and not only are we going to end voter suppression, we are going to make it easier for people to vote. it is not a radical idea to say that if you are 18 years of age in this country and a citizen, you have the right to vote, and of discussion. -- end of discussion. [cheers and applause] when we are in the white house, we are going to protect a woman's right to control her own body. [cheers and applause] that is a decision for women all across this country, not the federal government, not the state government, not the local government, but a woman's decision. [cheers and applause] make no mistake about it, the struggle we are engaging in is not just about defeating donald trump. the struggle is about taking on the incredibly powerful institutions that control economic and political life of this country, and i am talking about wall street. if you think we are going to get affordable loans to small businesses, you are going to have to deal with wall street and start breaking up these huge banks. [cheers and applause] if you think we are going to get medicare for all, we will have to take on the insurance companies. if you think we are going to lower drug prices in this country, we are going to have to take on the pharmaceutical industry. if you think we are going to end never-ending wars and lower military spending, we are going to have to take on the military-industrial complex. if you think we are going to protect family-based agriculture, and organic agriculture in this country, you are going to have to take on agribusiness like monsanto. if we are going to bring about criminal justice reform, we are going to have to take on the prison industrial complex. [cheers and applause] now, i say that just to give you an idea how hard the struggle is. it is not a question of someone coming before you and wanting to do the right thing. it is somebody coming before you and understanding that we need millions of people to take these folks on who have unlimited amounts of money. you're going to see the 32nd ads all over the state. they have the money, they have the power, but we have something together that they do not have. we have the people. [cheers and applause] and they understand that. you know, there is a simple arithmetic facts. when we talk about the 1%, they are 1%. we are the 99%. [cheers and applause] if we stand together, and by the way, the political tactic is what demagogues always do. they understand when ory -- when ordinary people, what do they want? health care, good jobs, they want good education for their kids, they want to be able to drink good water and breathe clean air. they don't want war. that is what people want. these guys win elections by dividing us up. somebody over there was a different color? somebody over there is a different sexual orientation? somebody came from mexico? somebody over there is gay? our job is to stand up to trump, and not let him divide us up. [cheers and applause] and if we stand together, as black and white and latino and asian and native american, if we stand together as gay and straight, men and women, nativeborn and immigrant, if we stand together as rural and urban, north, south, east and west, if we understand the important reality that there is no such thing as a red state or a blue state, the truth is, there are 50 states in this country. in every single one of those states, working people are struggling hard to take care of their families. that is the reality of america. [cheers and applause] brothers and sisters, i am here today to ask for your help in winning the democratic nomination, and uniting our party and our people to defeat trump. but i am also asking your help to stand together so that we can create an economy and a government that works for all of us. and when we do that, when we stand together, the future of this country is enormously great and i am very optimistic. let us stand together, let us go forward. thank you all very much.

[applause]\nwelcome back to new hampshire.\nit's great to be back. i went to high school at phillips exeter. i graduated in 1992.\na quick look at your bio, suggest you are a pretty good candidate for the american dream. great education, you went to brown, and a law degree, not to brag, but so far so good. practiced corporate law, decided that is not what you want to do, become an entrepreneur and succeed in a way that we would like to hear about. at this point you are married, got kids. you could be doing a lot of things, but you are here. we love it, but you are working. why are you doing that instead of counting money?\nafter my company was sold in 2009, it was a tough time for the country. a ficial crisis aftermath, and i had seen all these were his kids heading to wall street and silicon valley, and i thought it would be great if they did something better. you can't just complain about something, so i quit my job and started another organization to help train entrepreneurs in places like detroit, cleveland, baltimore, and helped create jobs over the next five or six years. i became convinced that the reason why donald trump is our president is that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs, all the swing states he needed to win, and my friends in silicon valley know that we are about to do the same thing to retail jobs, call-center jobs, and truck driving jobs in the years to come. so this is the fourth industrial revolution where the third inning of the -- donald tripp is the symptom. he is a manifestation. i am running for president because we need to wake up to the fact it is not immigrants that are causing economic problems. it is the fact that technology has advanced to the point where americans are finding trouble finding a way forward. we need to propose solutions to help address these problems. as much as i love my family, this seemed more important, so i said, i can take this message to the americans and start to solve some of these problems and improve people's lives.\nlistening to a lot of your interviews, you have caught fire in the last few months, and it gets you on the debate stage this summer, and it gets you attention relative to even say six month ago. the centerpiece deals with the freedom dividend. talk a little bit about that for the folks at home that maybe are not familiar, and it seems like not the sexiest thing to build a candidacy around, but it is impactful.\ni think it is very sexy, myself. i was just saying hello to jodi and chuck, who are receiving the dividend here. what we are doing for jodi and chuck we would like to be able to do for everyone in the country. the dividend is a policy where every american adult gets a thousand dollars a month. and those of you here in the room think that sounds too good to be true, but then you look at our history, thomas payne was for this. he called it the citizen's dividend. martin luther king, milton friedman endorsed it said it would be tremendous for america, and one state has had the dividend for years, where everyone receives between 1000 and 2000 dollars a year. what is the oil of the 21st century? technology, that is right. so what they are doing for people in alaska with oil we can do for everyone here with technology money. thing about what that would mean for the people you know. it would be a game changer for many people.\nyou alluded to milton friedman espousing this. nobody will mistaken him as a bastion of the left. he is the free market, the godfather of free-market economics. what are the most -- one of the most common questions i here ask is how the heck you are going to pay for it? tell folks about how we pay for that.\nhow much did amazon pay in federal taxes in 2000 18? zero, that is right. how much did netflix pay? also zero. it is not just those two companies per you can go down the list where the big winners from our -- artificial intelligence and these new technologies are going to be the biggest companies that are not paying a lot of tax. amazon is getting another $20 billion in business every year, and it is causing stores to close. what is the most common job? retail. the average retail worker is a 39 euros woman making between $10 and $12 an hour. we know americans don't have a lot of savings. amazon is sucking up business. workers don't know what to do, and amazon pay zero in taxes. how are you going to get some of the games from these innovations? we need to join every other economy in the world and have an iu batted -- value added tax. then put this money into your hands, and grow your economy by almost 14%, and some of that would float back up to amazon. they would get a little back. but we have to make sure that americans are in a position to benefit from these innovations, and right now we are not.\nit seems like the jobs that are at greatest threat in the future are a certain type that are you might -- that you might say are blue-collar. this is going to affect everybody.\ni was a corporate attorney for five unhappy months. i know that job can be automated . the same with accounting, bookkeeping, a lot of insurance brokerage jobs, radiology -- actually radiology they can automate right now. it starts out as a manufacturing worker displacement, but it will morph into retail workers and call-center and bookkeepers and accountants. the underemployment rate right now for a recent college graduate is or to, and it you graduated, and you expect a path forward, 94% of the new jobs that are created are temporary, and part of that is because a lot of the firms have already been automating away the entry level white-collar jobs from 10 or 20 years ago.\nyou said we are in the third inning of this game. it is well underway, but why is this different? in the history of destructive growth -- creative destruction, how come this time it is different from those other times?\nthis time technology will impact a broader range of industries faster than in previous periods. as a reference, bain projects we will eliminate three to four times as many jobs more quickly than happened during the industrial revolution. the first industrial revolution was unpleasant. there were riots that killed dozens of americans and caused billions of dollars of damage. we implicated universal high school in 1911 in response to these social changes. they bidet became a holiday. neighbor unions were formed in part because of the need to agitate for worker rights. so the people who say we have been this before, one, that was a turbo lint time with massive responses, and also experts believe this time it will be more vicious.\nyou mentioned the scapegoat of immigration. there's always this upset of americans who say if we just cut down on immigration, that would solve it. we know that is not so. what about globalization and the relationship that has two automation, but also separate, --\naccording to people who have dug into this, 80% of this was due to automation and machines, and about 20% is due to globalization. if you go to a factory today, you will see it is wall to wall giant robot arms and then a small handful of people walking around ministering to the robots. it is not like you walk in and see wall-to-wall emigrants. -- immigrants. the numbers don't bear out the narrative that it is somehow emigrants causing this, but it is easier to blame them than an economic system that put machines ahead of people.\nwhat is the hardest part of selling this? i think you're the only candidate that is openly support -- i hear you are having some impact on some of the candidates, but you're the only one saying this is a big deal. how is the salesmanship process going?\nmost americans are just tuning in. they are not like you all in new hampshire where they are actually paying attention, but i just tell americans, what we are going through as a country. our life expectancy has declined because of a surge in drug overdoses and suicide. our labor force participation rate is the same level of ecuador and costa rica. we have these statistics that obscure the dark reality, and president trump ran on the reality, and the reality has not changed that much during the last two years. you can talk about the salesmanship, but it is drying -- trying to draw attention to what people are experiencing. it is up to the democratic party to enact solutions to the problems that got him elected instead of just dismissing those concerns of lands of americans.\nno other candidate has as much detail on his or her website as you two. i am not sure what you are up to in terms of -- what is the number now?\nwe are something like 75, and we will release another like 25 or so in the next month. we will release a policy at day just because we have them. we have had them for a while. i think that's one reason i like steve, because he likes policies, for those of you who have been to his events. we have to start focusing on real solutions for the american people instead of arguing in symbols and various wars of words. i don't think that is what we are looking for at this point.\nyou mentioned suicide rates. on a personal level, this has affected my family, and it opened my mind up to events i was happy, bringing up the topic. once that event comes up, the number of people who would say, you have opened the door, i have been touched in some way, different ad comes -- outcomes, successful or not. you realize how complicated the issue is, the gun issue, mental health, health care in general. talk about this relationship between mental health and how we get our health care in this system in general, guns, how do you see them connected? where does that fit in your public policy?\ni am passionate about investing in american mental health. you can see we are at crisis levels of anxiety and depression . my brother is a psychology professor, and so i know we can do more. part of his -- part of it is we have this messed up system that is driven by revenue. when you show up, it's like i have ficial incentives attached to certain things. there are environments where they tie together your physical health and mental health because there is a mental health element to problems. if you come in because of some drug addiction, that is not like a physical addiction. it often has to do with your mental state. the challenge for us is to try and have a care system not driven by money, driven by what's best for us. that is a change, but i am happy to say there is an appetite for that change because americans are waking up to the fact that our health care system is breaking our back. if you get sick in this country, you are more stressed out about navigating the system then you are about getting help. there is no reason for that. we are the richest economy in the history of the world. we can do better in terms of putting resources in people's hands that will help address this.\non this issue, democrats in this field are in the same general area, there are --\nthank you, bernie sanders.\nbut there is a range in their from medicare for all to something that says you can buy into it, but keep your private insurance, so there is this range. where do you fit in that range?\nthe robust public option, medicare for all but don't eliminate private insurance off the bat. if you do it right, your option will end up making private insurance unappealing in many environments. that is for us to accomplish, and then you also have a time lag for the industry to adjust. if american is going to be private insurance, that is not a terrible thing for a public option, because if you have some goldplated plan, then they can invest resources that we can benefit from in the public space.\nwhen you look back at your experience, the whole thing, what are things that you look back at your life that had the greatest shaping on how you see the world through public policy?\nafter my start up went bust, you are sitting up here, obviously, illustrious career, law, block, but that -- blah, bl ah,, but that flopped. you have to put on a brave face all the time for everyone else. how is it going? it is going great. i am very passionate about small businesses and the purpose, the vitality they provide. i think it is beautiful when you have a small business that grows and hires people and puts people to work. the software company i worked at after my company went bust was a health care technology company. i understand how the system -- how the system is broken. i ran a national education company so i have very strong feelings about education. someone joked, it is almost like you are taking a tour of the economy in case he decided to run for president. which was totally the opposite. i would be the first to say i never thought i would run for president. it wasn't in the vocabulary of immigrant parents. each of those experiences all had a very profound impact on me.\nyou mentioned entrepreneurship. we have seen a collapse in entrepreneurship. so many jobs in the economy get created by a small percentage of new ventures that take off, so it has a drag on the economy, so why are we seeing this relative collapse in entrepreneurship, and what can we do to reverse that?\nif you think about it, what business might have started a generation ago? a hardware store? something on main street, and none of those businesses make any sense anymore. also, the average student loan debt is up to the 8k. their home ownership is being pushed back. in the past, you might have not had debt and maybe had a home you can lean on for some seed money to start a business. all of that is completely gone. the third thing, which is related to the first is that there is this mythology that the internet makes everyone an entrepreneur. it does not. it gives everyone a social media account. those are different things. we have actually raised the bar to start your own business here because many of the opportunities have gotten streamlined out by the internet.\nyou mentioned highest average college loan debt of any state in the country, and we are sitting in it right now. i found in my own experience, not just for the students carrying the debt, but for the parents of those kids that either were helping pay it or they felt awful that they knew their kids were in the position you just described. what do we do as president, at the federal level, what can we do to deal with this debt that we are dealing with?\nthis is a mountain of school loans. it has gone up more than 15 times in 20 years, and why is it, in part because college has gotten two and a half times more expenses -- expensive. there hasn't been a mass of equality -- a massive quality increase. why is this question because of dr craddick both in the colleges. it is not professors or buildings. you had massive administrative and bureaucratic growth, and if you are a family with this price tag, you feel like you have no choice but to pay, and the government is like, it's ok, we have this loan package for you. so you have to try to attack this at every stage. it is so mammoth that to me the right thing to do is to forgive a significant shock of the student loan debt. you have to ask yourself, what would we rather our young people do? stay at home living in their parents's basements, trying to dig out from the debt, or starting a business, starting a family, buying their own home, doing the things to move society forward. this debt is a stimulus of the economy. during the ficial crisis, our government had a choice, bailout the banks or forgive the mortgage debt that many americans were holding. he chose the banks, not we, i mean none of us would have, i don't think, but our government did, and said here's all this money. the american people lost their homes. i'm going to suggest that the student loan out note debt -- mountain of debt is analogous. we should say luck in power our young people to guide the society forward and forgive a lot of the debt that was immorally generated, anyway.\nhow about education, before folk -- folks who get to post secondary, how early -- in this state we are finally talking about full day k before we even talk about pre-k. let's say pre-k through 12, what is the current state of american public it -- public education?\nthe daily show -- the data shows that 70 to 75% of academic performance is determined by factors outside of school. that is parental time, how may books get read to them, stress levels in the household, the neighborhood, and we are putting our teachers in impossible situations. but we are going to hold you responsible, so the first thing we need to do is get money into the hands of families. that is what this freedom dividend would do. this will help give the kid a better chance to learn, and it helps the teachers do their jobs. if you get the money into the hands of families, that helps. the second thing is we need to pay teachers more. the numbers are clear, and that as a profession we are having a hard time both in enlisting and retaining teachers. we just don't trust our people. if you gave a school a lot of money, the last thing they would do is pay the teachers. they would be like, what are we going to do? we are going to highlight -- hire consultants. the data says the best thing they can do is give the teachers more money. we should. the third thing is we need to invest in vocationally -- in vocational entrepreneurship. the six-year graduation rate from a college right now is only 59%. we have thousands of kids starting college who don't fish -- finish. so we have to say there are other paths to a fruitful life other than college. that includes technical, vocational apprenticeships. only 6% of high school students are in this training. in germany that percentage is 59%. we have to have a public awareness campaign, and say these jobs are awesome, and then that will also make teachers' jobs easier.\ni want to get to audience questions, but a few other topics, the way we fund elections. the incentives that the democratic national committee has put forth have had perhaps intended as a consequence hitting a lot of people into the game at often low dollar, but being invested in nascent campaigns. you and pete buttigieg are two candidates who have able to embrace this threshold, 65,000 donors, a certain amount, at least 200 and 20 or more states, so fairly spread out. and if you reach that threshold by may you would qualify. you went from fewer than 10,000 to 65000 and like a month. talk about what is going on there and what can we learn about this to bend public policy so that this is the norm of how candidates fund their campaigns rather than this present anomaly.\ni think many americans are open to a different way of funding campaigns because right now the concern is there is this -- these pipes clogged with money. that is one reason i love being here. you all know if you'd get behind a candidate, the vision can sweep the country. most americans don't feel like that. so we are thrilled that we have had such incredible enthusiasm for my campaign. as you said, i just qualified for the debate last week, so you will see me both in june and july. a lot of that was fueled by small donors, most all of it -- our average donation is only $19. i joke that my fans are even cheaper than bernie's. to me this is the essence of democracy. it is a beautiful thing. i will say that there are a lot of the traditional funders in the democratic party that are potentially lying in wait. they will get behind candidates after you decide who you want to support, so this is a golden opportunity for us to move the party in a direction very fast because it's not just a bunch of rich people that will be able to make the decision.\nwhat would you describe -- what are the factors causing you to experience this growth? there are a lot of different -- not our perfect, low dollar donors, hit searches on google, by all of these relatively new metrics, there is this -- what is going on?\nif i had to chalk it up to any one thing, it was that joe rogan podcast i did that has been c on utah -- youtube and probably heard by -- and there was a few other things that happened during the same time, like freakonomics, but all of a sudden i became cool. it was wild. i am very excited about it, but there was this chemo to affect where i think when people start telling their friends, have you seen this? and then that just snowballs in a way that it became viral. i am a numbers guy, so i look at the measurements, and you see trends, and ordinarily after a media, you would see it go up and down. but this time it just kept going up. i am happy to say it started building on itself.\n20 years ago, you were 24 years old. i know you mentioned earlier you do not think you'd be running for president. what did you think you would be doing when you were 44 years old?\nwhen i was 24, i was just hating my lot firm job. then when i was 34, was ceo of a growth company that was doing well, and then it had just been sold. then i was driven that it seemed to me like all of the energy of the country was doing a few things when it started -- needed to be starting businesses and more communities. i thought at the time, i mean i love this country dearly. my parents created a great life for me and my brother. i thought this was my opportunity to give back. i did not realize that the problems in this country were so big, and they were about to accelerate and take off. the 20th century economic relationship that so many of you have taken for granted for years are breaking down. as an example, 20th century economics, if i started a successful company, you will assume a number of things. i will hire people and pay them well and need to make sure that they can buy my goods and i care about what happens in my backyard. today i can start that company and not higher lots of people. if i do, i can treat them all like gig workers. i don't care about my own backyard because i am sort of everywhere and nowhere. our system is not accounting for this. we are stuck in the past fighting food fats from -- fights from the past. some people think of me as a futurist. i am a presentist. i know what is around the country -- corner. the more people know, the more concerned they are. i will finish with this, president trump is either unaware or disinterested --\npresident trump is either unaware or disinterested in what is going on. it strikes me, and i hope i don't miss her so -- mr. brett this -- misrepresent what you are thinking, but this is a primary point of how people are going to decide -- it is a fascinating and exciting field. they really want to beat president trump. they have their favorite. they may have their favorite are several in terms of candidates. but i am will -- they are like i am willing to go to my second or third or fourth favorite if they could just beat donald trump. tell me why are you the person best match up to beat him and what is his rightist vulnerability that we as democrats should be going after?\nso donald trump is our president in part because he got some of the problems right, but the solutions are the opposite of what we need. he is saying build the wall, turn back the clock, and i'm saying we have to do the opposite. we have to turn the clock forward. we have to start devolving in notions of both work and value and how the economy should revolve around us. i am 100% confident i would beat donald trump in a general election because i am already getting thousands of independence -- independents. we are at a rest stop, and a i stopped me and said he was going to vote for me. i am getting thousands of republicans from around the country saying that i am what they were hoping for when they voted for donald trump. i'm going to get the progressives and the democrats because i am about getting money into the hands of families and making committees stronger, but i'm going to peel off a chunk of the libertarians and the rest of it because they see i'm trying to solve problems. despite the fact that i am kind of his polar opposite, and the line that i use is the opposite of donald trump is an asian man who likes math.\nthat seems like a good point to end this portion. why don't we take some questions from the audience. i think we might have a microphone that will be hovering around to capture your question. i will start right over here.\ni was very interested listening to you. to make change in this country in the office of -- is the office of president the thing to do when you have mcconnell and other people blocking everything you might want to do? and the other part of the question, with your ideas of moving forward and recognizing the problem, in lordstown, ohio, where they disclosed the plant that made the gm cruise, what about those people? the president says i insist you hire those people back, but what are you going to do for those people?\ni want to say, thanks to you all, if i could become president, we all know why, because the asian man who wants to give people money every month, just became present. then mitch mcconnell and the conservators -- conservatives would be like, wait a minute, this is a rebalancing of the economy that is funneling resources into these communities, and you don't need a super majority to get this done. the only state that has it in already is alaska, which is a deep conservative column estate. that is one reason i named it the freedom dividend, because it does better with the word freedom in it. we have to show people that we can get big things done, and then we can break down this polarization that is seizing up our government. as to the factory workers, you can't browbeat executives into going against their incentives. democrats and republicans are saying, hey, treat your people better, when every incentive is to do the opposite. i have been a ceo. it's all about the bottom line. i would say, here is $1000 a month, and let's try to have a meaningful path forward because we need to think bigger. we cannot go backwards. the path forward will be rocky, but it will get less rocky if we acknowledge what is happening in our communities and start putting resources to work.\nas a numbers guy, a question about the transformation of the tax code over the past 60 years and if you -- what might you think about that and how to change it.\nthe conservatives are really good at naming things. most of the changes over the last number of years have been bad, where the top tax brackets come down to much lower rates than it had been. i would move back towards more progressive tax brackets. i would do away with carried interest loopholes. i would treat capital gains the same way we do labor. i would bring the estate tax backup. i want to suggest that a lot of the stuff people are chasing right now will not rebound the academy -- the economy. i will use jeff bezos as an example. . he is worth a lot of money right now, and the vast majority of that is amazon stock. if i would to raise the top racket, it would not get us that much money or get that much money from him, because he is too smart to have a taxable event. he has not sold the stock. rich people are so good at hiding taxes, it is mind-boggling. i know this because some of my friends are like the tax lawyers that move stuff around for them. they are smart. we have a system that has made it possible for amazon to pay zero in taxes and for jeff bezos to go all the way to the bank. the reason why every other economy already has this tax, it is much harder to dodge and an income tax regime.\nit sounds like a much broader tax in that sense, which makes it harder to dodge.\nyes. let's say you're like, ha, ha, i can avoid this. let's say jeff bezos spends a billion dollars on his space company, which is what he is doing. a lot of these guys get fixated on going to mars. so then he spends $1 billion on rockets and whatnot, which is his prerogative. but then we get some money out of that, too. it doesn't matter if he manages to skip out on the income tax portion. when he starts spending it on all the suppliers and the people to build his rockets, we get money.\nwe have had three presidents in this century, all of whom are novices when it comes to foreign policy. some have done better than others. at this point what would make you stand out as you would be a novice, and why would you stand out differently than the others?\nmy philosophy -- my philosophy is that i think our foreign policy philosophy -- philosophy flex how we are doing at home. we elected president t -- president trump, and -- job one is to make us strong at our home at -- as a whole, and be able to project a policy that is more restrained because i think we have gotten ourselves into massive entanglements by deluding ourselves into thinking we can do things we cannot. it is a very unclear achievement in many contexts, and so my philosophy would be to say we have to rely more on our partners and allies, and then if we decide to get involved in something, we have clear goals.\nyou mentioned earlier, donald trump identified some of the problems, but terrible in the solutions. in terms of trade, and that america needs to trade for its own existence, success, less than a lot of other countries do on that basis, and that has worked pretty well since world war ii, but there have been a lot of changes. he has taken it strongly in one direction and seem to blow up a lot of relationships that have generally seem to keep us out of world war iii. where are you in terms of the rebuilding or creation in some cases of these alliances?\namerica has been the massive beneficial -- beneficiary of a world order that we helped create. you pull back on some of it. i don't think that is the right approach. i would rebuild relationships and become more multilateral in our engagements. i would push the power to declare military action back to congress. instead of having --]a [applause] i think many of our allies with fine need to be a partner. i am a cult hero and parts of asia. -- in parts of asia.\ni wanted to ask a question about the value added tax. you said it would be difficult for some of these corporations to wiggle out of. what is to stop them from passing on the cost to us and almost canceling out the effect of it? i guess i worry about a time in the future where everything has become so much more expensive because they will not take a hit on their profits.\nthe happy thing is that if you imagine in new hampshire, where everyone was getting an additional $1000 a month, that would be a game changer in a way then if some of your prices on amazon would go up a little. most of the money would stay here. you would spend it on tutoring and food, car repairs, a night out, like this place. it is a beautiful place. a lot of the money would circulate throughout the community. it is not like people in your community start gouging you, in part because there is still competition between businesses. an example i use is let's say i am president, and the dividend starts coming through, and you say we made the right choice. then you go out to the local burger joint, and all of a sudden there burgers are $10 instead of five dollars. you would be like, what happened? why is it so much more expensive? then you go someplace else, and it only takes one visits to not gouge you and then others follow suit. people would end up way ahead except for approximately the top 4% of americans, and right now they hold a lot of the wealth and they are spending a lot of it. the beauty of the system is we can get the money from where the money is and put it in the hands of families and consumers. if there is a price difference, it will not hit the people in new hampshire.\nhow would that affect people like us?\nthe great thing about value added tax is you can actually make it far more heavily on certain luxuries and exempt certain staples. my proposal assumes you have a blanket rate, but you can exempt things that people rely upon. the goal would be to have it so people have more resources in their families and communities, and then we are getting the money from where the money is.\ni am looking for a hand way in the back. the gentleman back there?\nalzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the united states, and directly affects people that either have the disease or the family members who help care for them, so if you are elected, what would you do to address this?\ni have friends whose parents have been struggling with this as well. my brother's researches this, so big picture, we need to do much more for aging americans generally and alzheimer's is a component of that. that is the way we need to move our economy, because the problem we have is we have gdp as our measuring stick. we see people with alzheimer's as like cost centers. we see our children as cost centers. the problem is that gdp is going to drive us off a cliff, because if you have self-driving trucks, it would be great for gdp, and terrible for humans. the goal is to make it so our health and well-being in the health of our seniors is the measuring stick that we have for the economy, and then we can move levels of resources in that direction. if you have loved ones suffering, sometimes it is expensive to manage care. insurance might not be able to handle a lot of it. so i would be all for helping make resources more robust and seeing caring for those families is a public obligation.\nyou have spoken on numbers issues, but how high are a priority as issues such as women's health and lgbt issues, and what do you plan to do to address\nour slogan is humanity first. i have a gay staffer and then some. i live in new york, so i have many lgbtq friends. they say to me that lgbtq americans are more likely to get fired from jobs, and if they had $1000 a month it would help them be able to make adjustments. they said it would be a game changer for people in that community in the same way it would for other americans. my wife is at our home -- at home with our two bullies, one of whom is autistic. what is the market value of her work right now? zero. it turns out that trying to evolve and our sense of measuring economic value is tied to women's issues in particular. we all know they do the vast majority of the uncompensated work in our society. so if the democratic party is going to be serious about this, we need to start moving economic resources towards women and something like the freedom dividend. there are thousands of women around the country who are stuck in exploited jobs that $1000 a month would help them improve. i am not saying that money is the answer to everything, but i am saying that it would make a bigger difference in many lives than some of the other things people are discussing. i am committed to having an lgbtq official at the highest levels of government. it is important for people to know that leaders represent society.\ni think you mentioned reproductive health. i just want to make sure i -- make sure you touch on that.\nthank you. i don't think men should have anything to do with deciding women's reproductive issues. we all know that if men got pregt, laws would be different. i think that men should just be, you've got this, and then leave, and i have a feeling i know what women would decide. it should be up to them to decide for themselves.\none of the things that does not get discussed a lot is, and you just touched on this, and i can say this as a white guy, the economy still pretty clearly advantages the white guy because of the way we have defined value of work. that is an and norma's question. we talk about policy in these fairly granular ways, and it makes it hard to get at these changes that would be required to begin addressing in order to fix a lot of the smaller things that we spend our time on. it seems like a lot of the policies, as you talk about universal basic and, begin to touch on almost everything else you're getting asked about.\ni agree that the economic system is very much geared towards men. if you're passionate about women's rights and empowerment, which we all should be, your choice as you go to each individual organization and say, you are geared towards men unfairly, which most of them are. so you go to each one of them, and tell them to try to make it better. that is a very difficult thing to change. what would be easier is if the majority of us say, you know what, the market does not determine our value. we are the centers of the economy, and we can declare this dividend and make it so everyone has some value and start moving from there. this is the great thing. i am a numbers guy. all we need is about 50,000 people in the state to get behind that message, and then we make it real. that is something we can do. we can control our capital flows much more quickly than we can control just about anything else. if i were to say to you, we need to change our schools. we know that is hard. if i want to say we can change capital flows and get everyone a dividend, can 100% do that. all we need is enough people to be able to embrace the vision of a trickle up economy from human beings up and we can make it real. that improves the lives of women and people of color and lgbtq americans in a way that we will be able to celebrate.\nfirst of all, thank you for coming up here. i am a future unemployed radiologist. there is something called this monetary theory, that we can keep accumulating debt, and things will be ok. i want to hear about your theory on that.\ni think that the deficit is an issue, and that we need to try to get our spending under control in some way moving forward. you can't just have rising spending ad infinitum. that said, we have the flexibility to make meaningful moves. if we decide to invest in our people, we can. as a businessperson, we talk about investing in people. but then in the public sector, it is the opposite. it's like, don't invest in anyone. we end up spending money on people anyway in and shelters and emergency room's. i was in new hampshire a couple of months ago and a corrections officer said to me, we should pay people to stay out of jail because when they're in jail, we spend so much. if we make this smith, i'm happy to say it will pay for itself many times over. particular spending seriously. there are things i would scale back and read channel because i don't think we have the ability just to print money and not have anything negative happen in the future.\nas a follow up we spend a lot of money on defense. it is the largest nonmandatory beltway in our budget. where are you on opportunities to do something about the sheer number of dollars we been to defend without optimizing our ability to defend ourselves in our interests?\nwe are spending 700 billion we know about on our military each year. a lot of that is going towards things that may or may not be ticketing to our safety. you have to look and think what are the true threats to our safety today. my list would go somewhat like climate change, cyber security and ai, infrastructure, loose nuclear material. does having a massive new aircraft carrier help with some of those plans? some of them, not as much. one of the goals i would have would be to channel some of military defense spending 23 structure. -- towards infrastructure. right now, our infrastructure is falling apart. it is literally becoming dangerous. many champions of the military-industrial complex will just be like job, job, job. these are jobs, too. let's make these happen. that is one way hopefully we can make our expenditures much more efficient. infrastructure has much more economic value.\nwhere environmental policies in regards to climate change?\nyou probably gathered, at the climate change is a serious existential threat where the last few years have been the four warmest recorded years of history. you don't have to be a scientist to think this is about to get even more catastrophic. i am for rejoining the para supports -- paris accords, division of the green new deal. two things that make me somewhat different from other candidates on this, first,, i think ficial insecurity is hand-in-hand in this issue. is 70% of americans are living paycheck to paycheck, they have a mindset of scarcity. if you go to them and say we need to worry about climate change, some of them will say, i can't pay my bills. the penguins will have to wait. we can control our capital flows much more quickly than we can anything else. we passed the dividend and get their heads up, we replace this mindset of scarcity sweeping our nation, 60-40 and then we got to them and say we need to worry about climate change, they will look at their children and say, yes we do. this is an accelerated to galvanizing around climate change. the other reality is that the u.s. is only 15% of global emissions. there is this mindset that if we stop or if we cut back, the entire world will stop warming. would be to start looking at carbon capture and other geo-engineering with the expectation that the climate is quick to warm regardless of our countermeasures.\nyou are markedly popular against the far right users -- you have taken a very bold step in telling people you don't want them supporting you. what is that like for you running a progressive campaign was far supporters and then telling them that you don't want their support?\nthis is a situation i never thought would be in. part of me is just like, have actually seen me? i am literally the son of immigrants. on a platform that is trying to help all americans. are completely disavow the support of any groups uphold the hateful ideologies are things that are electrically opposed to everything asked him for. a don't want their support. i wish i didn't have it. one thing i will say, it has spurred me to introduce my son to more quick -- people because -- introduce myself to more people because people don't know me.\na few more questions. i love the bright lights, it makes it better for viewing.\nyou have talked a little bit about the election fices, but can you speak a little bit about election reform and the electoral college and those controversies?\ncampaign-fice reform, to me is a huge priority. right now, americans are despairing that their democracy is not real and has been overrun by money. as president, i will pass a bill that puts 100 democracy dollars in the hand of every american citizen of voting age they can only give to political campaigns each year and the money disappears if you don't use it. the reason this is important is that if someone runs for office right now, let's call him steve, he can get lots of people behind him, but then maybe he has to go someplace else for money and he is an uncompromising principle sky and a lot want to do that. in the world of democracy dollars, if 10,000 people in new hampshire love steve, he will get $1 million. if there is some corporate interests being like, hey steve, i have $25,000, he will be like shut off i don't need it. which is the way it ought to work. do we want to get corporate money out of politics, yes. the better approach is to wash it out because if every citizen had $100, that would mean we have five times as much money than the companies currently spent on lobbying. in terms of electoral college, the reforms i am in favor of our little bit more new want and textured. if you had just popular vote, the truth is that candidates would just go to urban areas in big media markets. that is where would be all the incentives are. i think it is very bad form for democrats to be like, the constitution has a system. we have lost a couple of elections on that system, let's change the system. the constitutional framers had some intention in mind when they set it up that way. to me, there are reforms i would consider so that you don't wind up just hitting the swing states, where if i go to utah and get some people behind me, maybe i swing it a little bit and get an electoral vote or two, that would be a better set of reforms i would be in favor of. the entire popular vote thing has unintended consequences that i'm not sure people are really reflecting on.\nmaybe by congressional district?\nin in in terms of proportion?\nproportionality within state and congressional districts.\nthat would be an improvement because you would at least go even further and say based upon the percentage of votes, so if you can anyone in a district or two, that would be an improvement.\nwe do have a few states that already do that. maine and nebraska. think president obama won and electoral vote in the once upon a time.\nit happens. time also forwarding choice wanting -- voting.\nthis next election is not going to be campaign-fice reform. the big companies are not going to let what you are saying.how i going to communicate that to people so that they will vote for you? they are going to label you somehow because they are quick to lots of money to do that.\ni have the support of over 100 techies in silicon valley and other places. i say how you feel about that and they see not great. and then say would you be able to take a haircut to keep our country together? not all of them, half of them are like no,. but half of them are like, yes. sign me up. i just got a text message from the ceo of a major tech company congratulating me on the awesome work i was doing. this is not a polymerizing thing where some of these techies are parents, patriots. the thing is, we are all caps of to the system. they are doing their job, and their job is eliminating jobs. they don't fill great about it, but if you go to them and ask for help -- i can't get them all, but i can get some of them. i was able to speak to the ceos of a major bank. the folks at the top of american business see me as nonideological, quite practical. the other thing is that in a democracy, if i get enough people, it doesn't really matter what these people think. i'm a reasonable man and i am friends with enough of them where, it is not going to be clean-cut either way.\nthe quick follow up to that. now that you have been in this for a little while, what do you think of the way we pick presidents? i don't mean like the electoral college or the actual mechanics. i mean like the maelstrom of going to iowa and standing on a counter or going to new hampshire or anyplace, for the fact that a lot of states, you don't actually go there very much because it is like the 37th state on the map.\ni do get messages from people asking me to go to states and i like, i probably can't make it there. is there a reason for me to go to nebraska? think the political culture in new hampshire is so magical and special. i was at a house party and the person said, barack obama stood at the execs in place 10 years ago and gave a similar talk. just reflecting on what that meant. you were not just comparing us to each other in that moment, you are considering is to candidates from 12 years ago. you have seen it all.you have such a highly developed political culture and you know that your votes can change the course of history. you taken super seriously. i think this process has built up an incredible level of discernment and investment that i can't imagine it changing.having gone through it now in some measure. if you try to have some other state do this, they would have no idea what to do. there would be at a loss. i think the system has stood the test of time for a really good reason.\nwe can take two more questions and then give you a little bit of time to dive in. the angle of the chair matters so much. blood ago one, -- let me go 1, 2.\ni would like to address two things. the second amendment and farming.\nwhat about farming?\nlocal farming, big farming, address it all. [applause] -- [laughter]\non second amendment issues, i am pro-gun safety. i think that it is a tough issue because americans feel strongly on both sides.\nunion licensing?\nlicensing, classes. the treatment should be similar to what we do with vehicles. vehicles can cause accidents.\nwhy don't you address the constitutional issue then.\nyou have to get by and from congress. elected -- you have to have congress say there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but there are also legitimate public safety concerns that as long as you're not abridging the right fundamentally, as long as you jump through a couple of straightforward hoops, the average law-abiding citizen won't present undue difficulty, that could pass an appropriate standard. that would be my hope and plan a proposal to be like let's find an agreement with responsible gun owners. many responsible gun owners also want there to be some kind of process in place so that people -- that they feel better about the way people can access to firearms.\ni'm wearing the stone from new zealand. i'm a texan and i hope you will make some friends with people in the nra. the thing is, it is the constitutional versus the safety thing. you have got to do the bridge they are. -- there.\ni see myself as someone who is very pragmatic. my general stance is that we need to do more because there have been too many tragedies in this country and not enough to be done to curb them in the future. if you are parents, your kids are literally worried about school shootings on a daily basis. we can be better than that. farms our microcosm of what is going on with the rest of the economy. big business has crowded out small farms. the next generation doesn't necessarily want to take over the farm. you want up with huge succession issues. the big farms are just trying to buy you for less than what you are worth. we have to do more to combat the almighty dollar in the farming industry. we have to try to person of this corporate power we know is going on from some of the big suppliers. when i was in iowa last week, someone just told me about this company that is selling an automated tractor for $500,000. if you can afford that chapter, you are probably a pretty big farming operation. there are these things that are happening in agriculture that reflect what is going on in the rest of the economy, but we have to give the equivalent of small businesses, which in this case gives small farmers a fighting chance.\nfinal question.\nmy family has a lot of land in what is now israel. i'm just asking basically, what would you do to support people who are standing up against netanyahu and oppressive apartheid regimes in this country and how would your cost cutting internationally affect the amount of money we give every year to israel and countries like israel? [applause]\ni'm not sure actually said i would cut costs. what i said is that i would want to get lesson tingled -- what i had in mind was military intervention. in terms of the money we are giving to an ally like israel, my first instinct would be, why would we reduce it? certainly, if i communicated something else, that was not the idea at all. there are certain relationships we have that to me, we need to rebuild and strengthen. i would suggest that our relationship with israel is one of them.\nwhat about the arabs?\nyou would have to look at it on a case-by-case and say what is happening in terms of our bilateral relationship with a particular party. my zeal is to try to build a strong alliance and partnership with those that have been working with us for a long time. if someone has an interest in working with us, we should be open to rewarding that, too. for each country, you would have to look at what is going on at that time and with the lead and has been.\nwhen it comes to land in israel being taken even if it was granted to certain palestinian families by the u.n., how do you feel about restricting israel almost to prevent that from happening and constricting political influence by american leaders in israel?\ni'm not sure i will understand the question. i will answer it more generally. my stance on this is that it is quick to be hard for the united states to constricting like or just about any of its partners in a decision that they feel is central to the. i don't think that is our priority. i don't think we are somehow getting people aid so that we can than about things they find.\nyou will be available to mingle a bit. tell folks the website and how they can help.\nthank you all for this. let's give steve in round of applause. [applause]\nthis may or may not be clinical correct, that steve is my government.\ni don't even know what that means, but i appreciate it.\nthank you for coming out tonight. if you like to find out more about me and the platform, we have over 75 policies on the website. it is yang2020.com. if you just get a dollar to the campaign, we can keep you a present everything that is happening. you see this hardcover book here up front? the paperback comes out april 2. we have copies for everyone here on the desk. you can just grab one at will. i hope you enjoy it. please, come and ask questions. if you come with a book, i'm very happy to sign. thank you steve, and thank you new hampshire. [applause]\ni appreciate you coming.\ni appreciate you. wait to be such an awesome activist and boss.\ni am john and this is my wife angela. my whole life, i have wanted an outsider to take the presidency. it finally happened, but it was him.\nmaybe the wrong outsider.\non one of your republicans who have jumped ship. i am on your campaign now. i just wanted to ask you a little bit. on the chief of police of a small town north of here. what is your feelings with the divine right now between law enforcement and the public?\nit is a really hard thing because i know that being a police officer is a difficult, grueling job. the goal has to be to try to bring the two sides together and have more community policing where the police have the benefit of the doubt from the community because the people in the community are like, i actually know that police officer.\nalso on the police side of it, there needs to be more open doors. obviously, it is on both sides.\ni instinctively believe you would be the sort of person that would want to build connections. it is like a vital, integral job. many communities, the trust is that what it could be or should be. the question is, how do we build the trust? i disagreed to go on ben shapiro -- i just agreed to go on ben shapiro.\ndo you have any plans to hit some of the bigger towns in new hampshire? have been telling my family, you have to keep an eye on the sky. -- this guy.\ni will go to the big areas.\ni appreciate your sense of humor. that goes a long way. how could you not?\nthank you. so great to meet you.\nthis is only the second election i've had the opportunity of meeting everyone in the primaries because i didn't let here until the last election. you make a point of getting to everybody.\nif you are here and you have an interest, it would be criminal not to get to everybody.\nthere was one or two that we walked out on the second time around. he is in office right now.\ndo you want me to sign either of your books?\nboth, if we could.\nit so my to see someone of my generation running for office. because i hate to say this, we have to get some of those old fuddy duddies out of their. -- there.\nthank you. enjoy hearing you. medicare needs help, whether it is for everybody or just the old people.\ni should have been a doctor. my handwriting is not that great.\ndid you know that the schools don't even teach cursive anymore?\ni heard that. my son is not learning any cursive and it makes me so mad. i agree with you. we could use a bit of -- and our leadership.\ni only have three years on you and it is really refreshing to see someone of my generation saying, get your act up.\ni appreciate it.\ni was an organizer for the midterms. my sister is going to be a fellow at vsa this fall. i was wondering if you could sign this letter. her name is katherine. she listened to your joe rogan interview and loved it. look at that.\nyou come to this event and end up with a nice gift for her.\nmike turner. -- my turn.\nthank you.\nthank you.\nyou are very welcome.\nthank you for coming and i am praying for your stamina.\ndo i seem --\nnot at all. but just undertaking what all of my questions would be and in this room and all of the cities and towns you are going to, its huge.\nbut it is invigorating.\ni can see that. my husband wants is to look thank you very much. it's nice to meet you, sir.\nit's a game of monopoly but not everybody is getting $200 as they go around the board.\nit's nice to meet you.\ncould i trouble you for a picture?\nthank you very much.\nif i could follow up with that guy who is talking about israel, what is a two-state solution for israel? something to that effect.\nok.\nwe need to buy a t-shirt.\nthank you.\nthank you so much for coming.\nhi, nice to meet you.\ni am going to the north country and visit some places, like the factories closing and the rest of it. thank you so much for coming.\ngood luck.\nthank you.\nwho do you want to check made out to?\nfriends of andrew yang.\nif you need help, let me know. yang for president, i like that.\nanytime you can call me.\nok, great.\ni wish i had my calendar.\nthank you both so much. what a great

also visiting indiana, michigan, ohio and pennsylvania this weekend. (music) [cheers and applause]\nthank you very much! thank you for coming out on this warm, sunny, beautiful afternoon. [cheers and applause] i was leaving washington this morning and i was wondering should i take my coat or not? right decision. good. let me thank anthony and leslie kael for singing the national anthem. let me thank the shaun micheel band. let me thank james alexander for his remarks. and let me thank sarah trongone for introducing me and most of all, thank you very much for coming out this afternoon to complete the political revolution and transform this country. [cheers and applause] and i want to emphasize that what this campaign is about is not just winning the democratic nomination. it is not just defeating donald trump, the most dangerous president in modern american history, but it is about all of us -- not me, us transforming this country that is what this is about. [cheers and applause] this weekend, i will be not only here in wisconsin, but in indiana, ohio, michigan, and pennsylvania. four years ago, despite losing the popular vote by three million votes, donald trump carried all of those states and won enough electoral votes to be elected president. [jeers] together, we are going to make sure that that does not happen again. [cheers and applause] we're going to win here in wisconsin. [cheers and applause] we're going to win in indiana. we're going to win in ohio! we're going to win in michigan. [cheers and applause] we're going to win in pennsylvania. [cheers] and together we're going to win this election. [cheers] now, obviously, in our country, people have different points of view. here in wisconsin, in my state of vermont and all across the nation, and that is what democracy is about. you have your point of view. i have mine. but i happen top believe that whether you are a progressive or a conservative or a moderate, you are not proud that today we have a president of the united states who is a pathological liar. and i have talked to many conservatives who hold that view. the president of the united states becomes in many ways a model for the children of this country. and there are very few people who are proud that we have a leader today who lies all of the time. and in fact, he has lied thousands of times since he has been president and when he was on the campaign trail. and of all of the lies little and small that he has told, the biggest lie of all was when he said during the campaign that he was going to defend the interests of the working class of our country and that he was going to take on the powerful special interests to do that. what a monstrous lie that was. and let me give you just a few examples. as many of you recall here in wisconsin and all across the country, trump told the american people that he would provide health care to everybody. remember that? as president, trump did exactly the opposite. today, under the trump administration, 7 million people have already lost their health insurance and even more frightingly, trump vigorously supported an effort to repeal the affordable care act and throw 32 million americans off the health care they currently have. [jeers] and i say to donald trump, trying to throw 32 million americans off their health insurance is not defending the working class of this country. [cheers and applause] during his campaign as many of you will recall, donald trump said, hey, i'm a different type of republican. i'm not going to cut medicare. i'm not going to cut made cade. i'm not going to cut social security. people like paul ryan would do that. not me. i'm not going to do that. but i want everyone like i want the people of wisconsin to know, that trump's budget that he brought forth in march would cut medicaid by $1.5 trillion. cut medicare by $845 billion. and the last two budgets he brought forth would make cuts in social security as well. all of you know that medicaid covers 2/3 of the nursing home care costs in this country. i want you to think about the families in wisconsin, in vermont and around the nation who have moms or dads dealing with alzheimer's who are now in a nursing home. when you cut $1.5 million in medicaid, i don't know what happens to those people or the families who are trying to take care of them. cutting $1.5 trillion in medicaid and over $800 billion in medicare, is not supporting the working families of the country. trump promised when he ran for office here in wisconsin, all over the country that the american -- he promised the american people that the rich will not be gaining at all under his tax plan. remember that one? well, shock of all shocks, that turns time-out be a major lie. turns out that over a 10-year period, 83% of all of the tax breaks went to the top 1%. and the result of that -- the result of that is that today we have corporations like amazon, anyone know how much am zonl paid in federal income taxes -- amazon paid in federal income taxs? now, how insane is that that you have a widely popular corporation owned by the wealthiest guy in america, not paying a nick until federal income taxes and that's true for general motors chevron, eli lily and other corporations? they did not benefit the working family. they benefited the wealthy families and corporations. trump promised that he would substantially reduce the trade deficit and prevent the outsourcing of american jobs. but since trump has been in the white house, the trade deficit has gone up by $120 billion. and his own department certified that 185,000 american jobs have been shipped overseas under his watch. [jeers] during the campaign and i remember the ad he ran. it was a good ad. i, donald trump, we're going to stand up to wall street. remember that? oh, yeah, and we're going to reinstate the glass eagle act. well, trump has certainly stood up to wall street by signing legislation to deregulate wall street and provide large ficial institutions with a massive, massive tax cut. he didn't stand up to wall street. he did the bidding of the large wall street banks. trump's tax plan increased bank profits by nearly $29 billion. donald trump, you didn't stand up to wall street. you let your billionaire friends get away with murder. and that's just some of the lies that trump told the american people. and i can't understand why people voted for trump based on what he said. and the reason for that is that in wisconsin and all over this country, there are a lot of people who are hurting. there is a lot of pain out there. people are working two or three jobs. they're worried about their kids. they can't afford health care. can't afford to send their kids to college. and trump said, the political establishment is not listening to you. i will. -- listen to you. well, the truth is that for too long, the political establishment congress did not listen to the needs of working families. unfortunately, trump lied when he said that he would listen to their pain. so our job in this campaign is to reach out to working families who are hurting and to work with them, to finally create a government and an economy that works for all of us and not just the 1%. [cheers and applause] that is what the american people want. they're tired of being lied to. they're tired of seeing the very, very rich getting richer while we have 40 million people living in poverty and veterans sleeping out on the street. now, today, i want to welcome you to a campaign which says with confidence, with optimism and with love, that the underlying principles of our government will not be greed, will not be kleptocracy, will not be hatred, will not be lies. [cheers and applause] the underlying principles of our government will not be racism, will not be sexism, will not be homophobia, will not be xenophobia, will not be religious bigotry. those are ugly anti-american sentiments, and together, we are going to end all of that. [cheers and applause] the principles of our government will be based on a time honored american belief in justice, economic justice, social justice, racial justice, and -- and environmental justice. [cheers and applause] donald trump wants to divide our country up based on the color of our skin, based on our gender, based on where we were born, based on our religion and our sexual orientation. what we are going to do and what the american people want is exactly the opposite. we are going to bring our people together. [cheers and applause] black and white, latino, native american, asian-american, gay and straight. knave-born and immigrant men and women. [cheers and applause] that is what this campaign is about. it is bringing people together around an agenda that works for all of us. and when i -- when i talk about justice, let me tell you very exactly, very specifically what it means. it means that we will no longer tolerate a nation which has more income and wealth in equality than almost any other major country on earth. and it is worse now than at any time since the 1920's. now, i know that not a lot of people talk about it in congress and the immediate yap doesn't -- media doesn't talk about it. but we will not accept a situation in which the three wealthiest families in america own more wealth than the bottom half of the united states. where 20% of our children are living in poverty, 30 million americans have no health insurance, and yet, 49% of all new income goes to the top 1%. that is not -- [jeers] that is not the america we want to see. justice means that we will no longer see half of the people in our country live paycheck to paycheck. half of the people. do you know what that means? living paycheck to paycheck? it means that if your car breaks down, you can't get to work. and if you can't get to work, you get fired. and if you get fired, you can't take care of your kids. it means that you stay up nights worrying that your mom or your kid will not get sick and end up in the hospital because you cannot afford to pay the hospital bills. in the wealth yels nation in the history of the world half of our people should not be forced to live paycheck to paycheck. [cheers and applause] and when we talk about justice, we end the about -- absurdities of c.e.o.'s of major corporations earning 300 times what their workers are making. [jeers] and when we talk about justice, we end the situation in which 25 hedge funled managers on -- fund managers on wall street make double the amount of money of all of the kindergarten teachers in this country, 140,000 teachers. can you believe that? 25 hedge fund managers. and when we talk about ending injustice in this country, we are talking about ending the racial injustice that currently exists. [cheers and applause] at a time of overall massive levels of inequality and disparity, the situation is clearly much worse for black families. it's not acceptable to me or to you that african-american families own .1 of the wealth of white families, that infant mortality rates within the african-american community is two and a half times that of white communities. so when we talk about justice, we are talking about ending institutional racism in all of its form all over this country. [cheers and applause] and let me say a word to the young people of our country. at a time when we have experienced an explosion in technology and a huge increase in worker productivity, we will no longer accept a situation in which for the first time in the modern history of our country, the younger generation if we don't turn it around will have a lower standard of living than their parents. [jeers] younger people are leaving school deeply in debt. they can't find affordable housing. they have less social mobility. now, i've got four kids and seven beautiful grandchildren. downward mobility is not acceptable to me. and it's not acceptable to the american people. this campaign is about moving people up not down. [cheers and applause] but it is not just a fight for economic justice that we are waging. we are also waging a fight to end the corrupt, political system which allows the rich to get richer at the expense of everybody else. [cheers and applause] now, i have a very radical idea. you want to hear a really radical idea?\nyeah!\nnow, the right-wing media is going to go nuts on this one. i believe, and i'm say it right here, in one person, one vote. now, how radical an idea is that? and that means that we're going to end a political system which allows billionaires to buy elections. [cheers] we are going to overturn this disastrous citizen's united supreme court decision. [cheers and applause] and we are going to move toward public funding of elections. [cheers and applause] because i want more people to be participating in the political process. and i don't care what your views are. if you want to run for office, you're progressive, you're conservative, whatever you are, you should be able to run for office without begging wealthy people for campaign contributions. [cheers and applause] i want to say another word about democracy. i have run for office in the state of vermont on many occasions. sometimes i've lost more often i've won. but i can tell grow the bottom of my heart, it has never ever occurred to me nor do i think the vast majority of candidates in this country to figure out a way about how we could keep people from voting who might be voting against us. so i say to those cowardly republican governors who are working overtime to suppress the vote, to make it harder for people of color or poor people or young people to vote, what i say to them if they are afraid to participate in free, fair and open elections, they should get the hell out of politics and get another job. [cheers and applause] now, a few years ago when i was here in wisconsin -- and by the way, wisconsin, thank you very much for the support you gave me in 2016. [cheers and applause] we won a great victory here. but all of you will recall, you'll all recall that here in wisconsin and wherever we went around the country, the ideas that we brought forth four years ago were considered by the political establishment and by the media establishment ideas that were radical that were extreme, that were ideas that nobody in america supported. well, i think it's fair to say that things have changed over the last four years. [cheers and applause] i want you to remember this. when we talked about raising the minimum wage to a living wage, the establishment said, too radical. and when we dared say that health care is a human right, too radical. and when we talked about investing a trillion dollars to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create up to 15 million good-paying jobs, we were told that it was --\ntoo radical.\nand i was asked on a national tv debate and the moderator said, well, tell me, what do you think the major national security country -- facing the country is? many said alaska or isis. and the answer i gave was climate change. [cheers and applause] well, four years ago, that was a radical idea. it ain't a radical idea today. four years ago when we talked about criminal justice reform, we talked about ending the war on drugs an legalizing marijuana. [cheers and applause] and we were told, oh, my god, too radical an idea. well, state after state is doing just that finally. and when we talked about reforming our broken criminal justice system and our broken immigration system, we were told that those ideas were too radical as well and here is another idea that four years ago seemed so, so radical. and that is how could you possibly run for president of the united states without having a super pac and begging billionaires for campaign contributions? [cheers and applause] and here is one more idea which does not appear quite so radical today. four years ago we talked about ending power of super delegates at the democratic national convention. [cheers and applause] well, a funny thing that hand. the 21 other states that we won and the 13-plus million votes that we receive and the fact that we ended receiving more votes from young people than trump and clinton combined -- [cheers] what all of those showed is that those ideas were not radical ideas, they were common sense american ideas that the american people supported. [cheers and applause] and today, four years later, those very ideas are supported by democratic candidates from school board to president of the united states. in other words, we have made real progress in transforming the political debate in america. people now understand that those ideas are not radical. but those ideas are exactly what we need in our country. [cheers and applause] and let me tell you today exactly what the agenda is that i am running on for president. so today, we say as straightforwardly as we can through the private health insurance companies that whether you like it or not we are going to end the international embarrassment of the united states being the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right. [cheers and applause] we will no longer accept the absurdity of spending twice as much per capita on health care as the people of any other country while we have lower life expectancy rates than other countries and worst health care outcomes than other countries. in america if you're sick, you should be able to walk into a doctor's office. in america, if god forbid you end up in a hospital, you should not have to worry about going bankrupt. [cheers] so yes, we are going to take on the hundreds of millions of dollars spent by the health care industry and we will pass a medicare for all single payer program. [cheers and applause] [crowd chanting \"bernie\"]\nnow, let me tell you something -- let me just tell you something. this is not going to be an easy fight. and i want you to know this is not just another piece of legislation that's going to get passed inside the beltway. that's not the way it happens. i looked at health care and medicare for all in exactly the same way that i looked at the labor movement when millions of workers stood up and fought back and said they were sick and tired of being exploited. i look at medical for all in the same way as i look at the civil rights movement where african-americans and their white allies said together we are going to end racism and segregation and jim crow in america. [cheers and applause] and i look at health care as a human right in the same way as i like at the women's movement where women stood up and fought back and said we will not be second class citizens. [cheers and applause] and i look at medicare for all in the same way as i look at the struggles of the gay movement when the gay community said we are sick and tired of being discriminated against and we will love whoever we choose regardless of their gender. [cheers and applause] my point is that the fight for medical for all, the fight for health care is a human right. it's a strug that has got to take place at the grassroots level -- it's a struggle that has got to take place at a grassroots level because you will say, my kids are entitled to health. my disabled friends are entitled to health care. and every american is it into told health care. when millions of people stand up, believe me, the united states congress will hear them. [cheers and applause] and when we talk about health care, we are talking about taking on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry who are charging us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. [jeers] now, you want to hear about a dysfunctional health care system . all right. i'll tell you. [laughter] now, this is really crazy stuff. and that is that last year, the five major drug companies made $50 billion in profits. the c.e.o.s make outrageous compensation packages. and yet one out of five americans cannot afford to fill the prescriptions that their doctors write. just think how insane that is. people go to the doctor. they're sick. the doctor write as prescription. they can't afford to fill it. so we are going to tell the pharmaceutical industry that we in this country are not going to pay anymore for prescription drugs than the people of other countries which means we're going to lower prescription drug prices by 50%. [cheers and applause] and today we say to wal-mart and we say to mcdonald's and other low wage employers, pay your workers a living wage. [cheers and applause] people cannot make it on $8, $9, or 10 bucks an hour. in america if you work 40 hours a week, you should not be living in poverty. [cheers and applause] now proud that together we have pressured amazon and disney to raise their minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. [cheers] and six states in the united states have already passed legs for a $15 an hour minimum wage. and a few weeks ago, the united states house of representatives, education and labor committee passed reported out legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. [cheers and applause] we have come a long way in four years, but we need a pass movement to make sure that nobody in this country is working in starvation wages. when we talk about priorities in america, we should not be proud of the fact that in america we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. and we have a childcare system that is out of control. if you are a working parent, you have the right to know that your kid is in a quality pre-k program and that the staff is paid living wages. [cheers and applause] and that is why? we understand. -- that the early years of a human development from 0-4 are the most important, intellectually and mentally. that's why we're going to implement universal affordable pre-k. [cheers and applause] and here is another idea that four years ago was considered to be radical. ain't so radical now. and that is that in the united states we know we are living in a competitive global economy. we need to have the best educated workforce in the world. [cheers and applause] good jobs require a good education and that is why we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. [cheers and applause] how many of you are dealing with student debt? [cheers] all right. together, we are going to substantially lower student debt . [cheers and applause] here in wisconsin, the average student debt is $30,000 per graduate. that is pretty crazy. if you go to medical school or law school it's a lot higher than that. some if the united states congress in its wisdom could bail out wall street for a trillion dollars, you know what i think, i think we can substantially lower student debt in this country. [cheers and applause] and today, we say to donald trump and the fossil fuel industry that although it may not seem at this moment, climate change is not a hoax. and the truth is as i think all of you know that climate change is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet. and together we are going to take on the lies and the greed of the fossil fuel industry. [cheers and applause] you know what they remind me of? some of you may have known that 50, 60 years ago, the tobacco industry was telling the american people that cigarettes were not harmful. you don't know that? and as a result of that, millions of people including my own father died. people smoked two or three pax a cigarettes. and there were these ads on television, hey, cigarettes were not harmful. the tobacco companies held up their hands. we have no evidence to believe that tobacco is harmful. they lied. and the fossil fuel industry, their scientists know it. they know that what the scientists tell us that if we do not significantly and aggressively cut carbon emissions according to the best scientists in the world, there will be ir-reparable harm to this planet within the next 10 years. we have a moral responsibility to our children and our grandchildren to leave them a planet which is healthy and is habitable -- [cheers] and we are going to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficient si and sustainable energy. and when we do that, we are going to create millions of good-paying jobs. [cheers and applause] and today we say to the fossil -- today, we say to the prison industrial complex -- [jeers] that whether they like it or not, they are no longer going to make money by locking up fellow americans. [cheers and applause] we are going to bring about long overdue real criminal justice reform. [cheers] this is america. we should not be having more people in jail than any other country on earth. we should not be spending $80 billion a year locking up people in this country. instead of spending $80 billion a year on jails and incarceration, we are going to invest in our young people in jobs and education. [cheers and applause] and when we talk about criminal justice reform that means no more private prisons or detention senators. [cheers and applause] no more -- or detention centers. [cheers and applause] no more war on drugs. no more keeping people in jail because they are too poor to afford cash bail. [cheers and applause] and when we talk about criminal justice, we're going to change a system by which millions of people now have criminal records because of possession of marijuana while the c.e.o.'s on wall street who destroyed this economy who created a situation in which millions of people lost their homes, their jobs and their life savings, those crooks, not one of them, not one of them went to jail. we're going to change that type of system. [cheers and applause] we believe in equal justice under the law. if your wall street executive and you break the law, you pay the price. and today, we say that in stead of demonizing the undocumented immigrants in our country, we're going to pass come prehencive immigration reform -- comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship. [cheers and applause] we're going to provide legal status to the 1.8 million people eligible for the daca program. [cheers and applause] and we're going to develop a humane border policy for those who seek asylum. [cheers and applause] no more snatching babies from the arms of their mothers. [cheers] and today we say to the military industrial complex that we want a strong defense, but we do not need to spend more than the next 10 nations combined. we are going to invest in affordable housing. we're going to invest in public education. we are not going to invest in never-ending wars. [cheers and applause] and by the way, i'm happy to tell you -- i'm happy to tell you that the house and the senate recently passed a resolution using the war powers act successfully for the first time in 45 years to end u.s. involvement until the saudi-led intervention in yemen. [cheers and applause] and that is just the beginning of getting congress to retake it's constitutional responsibility onish sues of war. and today we say to the 1% in profitable corporations, people have never had it so good that under our administration we're going to end the massive tax breaks and loopholes that they currently enjoy. [cheers and applause] we're not going to accept the situation when major profitable corporations pay zero in taxes. the wealthy and large corporations will start paying their fair share of taxes. [cheers and applause] now, when i use the word -- we use the phrase \"us, not me,\" that is not just a good bumper sticker. it is a good bumper sticker but it's more than that. and this is what it means and maybe the most important point i want to make and something very few candidates will tell you, and that is that no president, no president, not bernie sanders, nobody else, no matter how well intentioned that person may be, no president of the united states can do it alone because the power of the establishment, the power of wall street, of the insurance companies of the drug companies of the corporate media of the prison industrial complex, of the military industrial complex, these people have unlimited amounts of money, and they have incredible power. so when we use the phrase \"us, not me\" what it means is that we need to engage in an unprecedented grassroots effort in which millions of people stand up and they look around them and they say, you know what, this status quo is not working for us. it may be work for billionaires. it is not working for us. and if we stand together and if we don't allow trump and his friends to divide us up, we can take these folks on and we can defeat them. [cheers and applause] and what we do in the white house together is we create a federal jobs guarantee. you want a job in america? you will have a job because there is more than enough work to be done. [cheers and applause] when we are in the white house, we're going to do what the american people want, and that is end the epidemic of gun violence. [cheers and applause] and pass common sense gun safety legislation. when we together are in the white house, we are going to protect a woman's right to control her own body. [cheers and applause] you know, i get a more than tired of hearing my conservative friends and my conservative colleagues in the senate saying, get the government off of the backs of the american people. they tell us about small government. let the american people do what they want. deregulate everything. well, if you believe in small government, if you believe in getting the government out of your lives of the american people, then you must support a woman's right to control her body, not the federal government. [cheers and applause] not the federal government, the same governments or the local government. -- the state governments or the local government. brothers and sisters, we are in a pivotal moment in world government. there's a growing movement toward authority tarnism and oligarchy. there is a growing movement toward racism and bigotry. [jeers] it's going on not only until the united states where we're seeing an increase in hate crimes where we have a president who is trying to win cheem political votes by demonizing minorities. that is what is going on. and what this election is about is whether we strengthen democracy or whether we move toward oligarchy. it's about whether we bring our people together or we have national leadership that tries to divide us up. it is about whether we have grassroots activism or whether we have billionaires who continue to control the economic and political life of the nation. in my view, if we are prepared to stand up to trump and his desire to divide us up, if we understand we cannot allow him to demon size minorities, to demonize undocumented immigrants, if we understand that there is no such thing as a blue state or a red state, but that in every state in this country, working people are struggling to take care of their families. if we are prepared to roll up our sleeves and get involved in the political process, if we are prepared to do all of that, at the end of the day what we know is that the 1% may have unlimited amounts of money. and they may have an enormous amount of power. but at the end of the day, the 1% is 1%. [cheers and applause] and i may not be a great mathematician, but the 99% is a lot more than the 1%. [cheers and applause] so brothers and sisters, we are fighting ifer the future of this country -- for the future of this country. we're fighting if democracy, to protect our children and our parents. we are fighting to preserve the planet. this is no time for anybody to be talking about being depressed or in despair. now is the time to get to work. not is the time to transform this country. now is the time to win this election. thank you all very much.

filed my federal and it seem like i got it cut. but i filed my state, which used to have a cap, i think it was $41,000, a cap on the taxable rate on pensions, but in kentucky, they lowered that cap and i paid it. i broke even on the whole thing.\nit is important to consider all levels of government as far as the tax burden. one particular issue with this law, as with many others on a federal level, whether states choose to conform their tax codes with changes made at the federal level. many states the couple -- dec ouple and not have a parallel credit or deduction, i have seen several states where the 20% small business reduction on the personal side.\nany thoughts, jhoosh?\nit is important to think of the federal, state, local, and even at the federal level we have different taxes with the federal income tax, which is what today is all about, corporate income tax, payroll tax, and different parts of that system are in terms of how progressive they are in their incidents or not and i think one of the reasons i am not a fan of the 2017 law is because it is one of the most progressive parts of our taxes to him, the corporate income tax, they decided that need to be cut. but it did not cut payroll taxes and did not do anything for state and local but that is outside federal jurisdiction. if you look at the overall portfolio of taxes in the market families this loss that we would reduce the ones that are paid disproportionately by the richest households and leaving most of the rest of the taxes to relatively unchanged. that is a big problem for me and a big burden for me as other parts of the tax system.\nnbc news said twice as many companies pay zero tax under the donald trump tax plans and the tax cuts and jobs that lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% in the first year and the companies pay no taxes went from 30% to 60%. michael in illinois, independent line.\ni have a comment and a question if you would bear with me. i am on social security. back in the 1980's they passed a law, i think it was al gore that pushed it over the top. they take half of your social security accounting to your income and i am lucky and i have a pension but i had to pay over this new tax cut law, $395 more this year than last. i am already counting into my savings every year just to make ends meet. we have been giving these tax cuts to corporations and the fat cats since ronald reagan. it has never worked. it has never trickled down. i would like you to explain why, like crazy people, do we keep going and giving tax breaks to people that are not going to do anything for this economy except by our politicians -- buy our politicians?\ni was start out by saying there was a fair amount of research that indicates that higher taxes certainly have negative impacts on economic growth. the tax foundation review 26 separate pieces of literature done over two decades, three decades and found all but three determined there was a negative correlation between high tax rate and economic prosperity. as for the trickle-down effect, research going back and forth on the effects of these laws, a lot depends on how they are designed. the across-the-board reductions on the 1960's after john f. kennedy were measured and increasing employment by 0.5%-zero .8% and revenues increased after the law. you cannot isolate all of those impacts but the evidence is mixed.\nyou think the trump administration learned anything from the reagan experience?\nnot really. but i think cutting taxes to the richest households is not an economic strategy that has paid off. at least under reagan, they did very large tax cuts and it increases as well. the part of the reagan tax legacy that has bipartisan support, the 1986 tax reform, which did try to do simple obligation and cut down avenues for gaming the system, the 2017 laws learned nothing from that. it was passed so hastily and i think maybe one hearing in congress or maybe zero. the changes to the corporate side have left huge loopholes. twice as the corporations paying zero taxes, that is in year one. the corporate accountants learned over time to get more loopholes. we already see a hemorrhaging of revenue and they did not learn good less is of the reagan tax cuts, just the bad ones which is delivering benefits to the top your.\ndavid in san francisco.\ngood morning. i am calling from the land of hyperinflation. we have been so exposed to fraudulent numbers for so many years that we are skeptical. america was founded on taxation with representation. the people who get taxed get to run their lives. if the superrich do not want to pay taxes, and they are not paying taxes, why do we allow them to run our lives? the structure of the current tax plan is designed to screw us. that is my first question. the second one is, how do credit speculators pay taxes?\nkeep that thought and we will get in one more call from thomas in texas.\nit is little elm, texas. for those people working now, obviously go to your home and -- human resources or employer and have a percentage taken out withholding, say 10% or, 20% if you can afford it. that will allow you to have more pay in your check, after you figure out you can do that, more pay in your check as it is now with the tax law. and with the withholding at a higher rate, you can also have a substantial amount of money coming back to you at the end of the year. the man on retirement with a pension, yes, that is an earned income in addition to social security but if he had taken a lump sum at retirement, he would not have been involved in that, he would have had maybe some sort of medications of account where they would send in a certain amount to his checking account which would not be counted as an income. i have a phd in accounting and i know what i am talking about and no this, every aspect of this new tax law.\nthank you. thoughts?\nthis brings up the interesting issue of withholding and refunds, probably the worst journalism we saw about the tax cut law this year has been the hysteria over tracking the weekly average amount of tax refunds and saying, that has to be because of the tax cut law. the refund on your taxes is simply an overpayment you made to the irs throughout the year without getting any interest for it. the refunds it turns out are pretty much about the same this year as they were last year on average. different people will have different experiences, they always do. a point that needs to be made is that the system remains too confusing to too many people and too scary and terms of the irs coming after them to adjust withholding to where they may come out even at the end of the year, many people are nervous about running afoul of irs with withholding that they go the opposite way, a mistake.\ngoing to your home and -- human resources and changing the withholding, some folks that are afraid of doing that or not knowledgeable about what they should be doing and come out even or get the small refund at the end of the year.\ni think all that is right. i will not give people blanket advice to tell their employer to withhold more. i owed this more this year because i had a little bit of a windfall, but it hurts because of human psychology. the part of the law that should have been straightforward for human resources department is how much to withhold from w2 wages and i guess they probably mostly got that right and there should not be a big effect. the people with more obligated income forms, they own a business, that gets more obligated. -- more complicated.\nthe budget season on capitol hill and the issue of the debt has come up regularly. comments from larry kudlow, national economic advisor of the effect of the 2017 law on the debt. here is what he said a week ago.\none economic indicator that has been damaged, critical of the deficit and the debt levels in the obama administration, we got new numbers, $691 billion deficit in the first half of the fiscal year and a trillion dollar deficit democrats say a big part of that is the tax cuts. the tax cuts paying for themselves?\nyes.\nexperts say absolutely not.\nthey always will.\nnonpartisan experts.\ni have to profit -- process that, nonpartisan expert part. interestingly, i just saw in february and march, year on year, federal revenues are coming in when you adjust for a day short in march or february, 90%, revenue is coming in nicely. i believe what will happen is, as a share of gdp, i think you have to look at things in relation to the economy, you will see the deficit steady lower. same for the overall publicly held debt.\nbased on what you heard from larry kudlow and the research, are the tax cuts -- will be tax-cut a for themselves?\ni do not think such -- will be tax-cut pay for themselves?\ni do not think so but economic growth can offset it, they would call static, the term dynamic analysis of what he of building in economic growth to the response of individuals and businesses with reduced rates or expensing of investments. some estimates that the long-term revenue loss dynamically from the tax-cut law is about $500 billion, as opposed to $2 trillion. i think it is in between, you cannot discount economic impact but paying for themselves is a stretch.\nthey are thinking the corporate tax cuts fire up more hiring and those revenues from those taxpayers, is that what he is talking about, the growing federal tax revenue?\ntwo channels to affect the economy, one is short run, just giving people in the economy more money to spend, dividends go up, stock buybacks, share prices, people are richer and spend more money, stimulus effect. the tax cut that limited stimulus effect because a lot of money go to the top who do not spend every last penny. and the economy did not need a lot of short run stimulus by the time the tax cut ran into it. it had some affect but not a lot. he is referring to long-run effects, the idea that maybe it induces businesses to undertake more tangible investments, buying equipment what enhances productivity which hopefully increases wages and the higher wages for -- pay more in taxes and you get high revenue over time. the long-run dynamic is not yet having -- i am skeptical but that is the help, over time you get more revenue and how they are self ficing, it has not happened yet.\nwe read an article earlier about the potential effect of the state and local income tax loss, new york, potentially california and other states. how do you see that playing out?\na couple ways, one, this is a cap state and local taxes you can write off on your federal income tax return. that was part of the law and that raises revenue because the cap on the deduction people used to take in and limited way -- unlimited way, from a state and local perspective, it makes it harder for them to raise taxes because in the past new york would raise taxes on his resident and save that may hurt a little bit but you can write it off on your federal. over the long run, that put a strain on fiscal resources states can raise. on the other hand, it is not an efficient way to help states raise resources, we could just increase federal aid to states directly. i think it is a standalone way to fice a generally flawed tax-cut and i am not a big fan of that self deduction. in the long run, we should figure out better ways to get the federal government to stay government.\ndavid in new york, democrats line.\nmy name is david. tw questionso, or comments -- two questions or comments, the standard tax reduction is only $12,000, $1300 for seniors and so forth. if you give more than $15,000 to an individual, you have to fill out a 709, a gift tax and a 2017 the maximum gift tax was about $5.5 million you could give away and in 2018 each individual is allowed to give away over $11 million. it went from 5 million -- $5.5 million to $11 million the next year and to you know who will benefit -- do you know who will benefit?\nthose were part of the changes of the tax cut law, the state gift tax, the state tax exemption rose dramatically. the point of the inheritance and gift taxes has been to try to redistribute wealth and reduce inequality. the evidence is mixed on that. why bill gale from brookings suggested we needed to raise the exemption from the tax index to inflation and make other adjustments so it is not quite as distortion it on medium-sized family and businesses. we moved towards that direction. some economists suggest in the long run for the revenue it raises, it may be worth getting rid of it entirely but congress did not do that.\nincorporates being reduced , how will small businesses do under this law?\nthe corporate tax rate does not apply to most of your mom-and-pop businesses, they are subchapter s corporations and sole proprietors that file through the 1040 system and upwards of 50,000 c so-called corporations, the weight who pay the -- the ones who pay that, migrate out of the system on an annual basis and may have been forming businesses in other types of structures.\njackson, tennessee, independent line, ed.\ngood morning. this system is not crippling our businesses around the world it is warren buffett come it is health care, 1960 corporate taxes were 4% of gdp and today it is about 2% of gdp. health care was about 5% of gdp in the 1960's and now it is 17.6% of gdp. as warren buffett says, it is not taxes, that are in entitlement, it is a distraction, but it is health care costs as we spent $3.6 trillion per year and one trillion of that is wasted, we should have more money and we should not be cutting taxes for the wealthy. it is insanity to cut these taxes. trust but verify these numbers.\njosh?\nthere is a lot of truth to that. on the first point, u.s. corporate tax rate before the police 17 law was not an impediment to u.s. corporations doing business, i agree. there are claims the u.s. corporate tax rate was hurting our competitiveness in the global economy but that is not true because 35% of statutory rate, most corporations after they got their accountants involved, paid less than that. he raises a good point, there are other pressures on american working families in this economy, health care, low wages, why do we spent all these times fixing profitability through the tax code. it is longing -- looking at the wrong price.\nthe colors -- callers talked about the rich not paying their fair share, frustrations the pew research center found on the tax year, tops tax frustrations feeling some wealthy people and corporations do not pay their fair share, feeling that some corporations do not pay their fair share, 60% feeling that some wealthy people do not pay their fair share and 60%, 62% on that top line number.\nmary on the independent line.\nguest: -- caller: i belong to a club, mostly woman's club, 19 people have realized after paying their taxes that mostly republican women feel they have paid a lot more than last year and the working class has been hoodwinked, this trickle-down economics is a total con game. this tax-cut is only making 1% of the rich even richer. it adds $2.5 trillion to the deficit. we feel that larry kudlow is a liar, just like trump. and mitch mcconnell and donald trump and the republicans have hurt the working class.\nyour own experience in terms of your tax bill, more than you expected in terms of what you are paying this year?\nmy husband does the taxes and he mentioned that we are not getting the deduction he got last year. the deduction is a lot less.\nthoughts?\nit would be good to put this in perspective, the cbo says that our tax system, as it currently stands, is progressive. oecd data suggests the industrialized nations around the world suggest that our tax system, even in comparison with many other countries, is highly progressive and we lean heavily on the top 10th of earners. cbo says the top 1% pay an effective federal tax rate all inclusive income payroll and excises of about 33%, the most recent data. that is down two points from 1979. 1/5 of earners pay less than 10% -- the bottom fifth of earners pay less than 10%, 5%, that is way down from 1979. if you want the system to be more progressive, ok, but you say it is not progressive currently, the facts do not support that and the fact that we have individuals getting away with paying low taxes does not really change the overall picture.\njoanna in damascus, maryland, democrats line.\nthat lady stole my thunder but i remember an old cartoon, i will gladly pay you tuesday for a hamburger today and that is what is going on with this new tax code. this idea that the f visit is exploding -- the deficit is exploding, debt is going way up and at some point somebody will have to pay for it. the second thing is that it is all about me now, not about us. all the departments, federal departments, have been drastically slashed. including the agriculture department, you have somebody on from the national farmers union the other day and the agriculture department homeland security, everything is being drastically cut. we have less money to operate and do the things we need to do in the federal government. the people at the lowest end of the economic strata are getting hit hard. the people that can least afford it have a higher tax burden. and not as many services. i think those are both important things.\njosh?\ni agree, in the long run to have an effective government and provide vital services for a broad range of people, we will need to tax people more. the natural place to look for more money to start is the top 1% and 5% that are having hugely disproportionate income gains with a huge amount of money being redistributed but we tax it more lightly. on the deficit, economically i am not concerned about the deficit now. long-term interest rates are low. politically, the increase to the deficit is often utilized in a cynical way with a group of people, republicans in congress, who just asked a deficit fice act, and literally in the budget this year by the president they scream about deficits being too high and offer steep cuts and program that benefits a large group of people. economically deficits do not scare me but politically they are used as a way to beat back services for a broad range of people but do not come and play with taxes for the rich.\nfolks at the low end of income scale, the earned income tax credit we talked about earlier, a quote with america's tax law, they say you would think the irs in an effort to bring in more money will focus primarily on auditing wealthy taxpayers but a disturbing piece found that recipients of the early income tax credit on the u.s. big anti-party programs aimed almost exclusively at the working poor were twice as likely to be audited as people earning $200,000-$500,000. i will show the map of the audits which shows a large part of the southeast and desert west and west coast. remind us of the earned income tax category?\ni spoke with the reporters on this story and there are two issues, one they do not cover well, the earned income credit was a program created over three decades ago designed to offset the income and later to payroll taxes, that working families are liable for. an anti-poverty program, efficient administratively compared to others. one problem with the earned income credit is that the of session with -- obsession with improper payment rate, there are improper payments in the programs but it was discovered recently that by holding these credits at the irs, while we verify income and eligibility, many families are being deprived of the important short-term short -- cash and 40% of the earned income credit to the irs withheld were improperly withheld themselves in the name of trying to detect improper payments and we have a genuine problem with over auditing in that program. we have a genuine problem with the simplicity of that program. if you can claim a child tax credit you should be able to claim the earned income credit under the same rules. you cannot now and that is why there is confusion in the program.\nthe comments of the irs commissioner who was asked about this auditing and the issue came up at a hearing, a senate fice hearing last week.\ni want to ask you about the earned income tax credit recipients being more likely to get audited than millionaires. you heard me go through the numbers. it is shameful that poor people in humphrey county, mississippi, have the highest audit rate in america but if you are a high flyer or running a shell company , you will not likely get audited. earned income tax credit audits make up a higher percentage of audits since republicans have taken the budget act to the irs. here is my question, is it really the intent of the internal revenue service to audit taxpayers who are struggling to make ends meet while increasingly letting millionaires and multinational corporations off the hook?\nno.\nwhat are you going to do about it?\nwe are alert -- looking at the earned income tax credits, there is an $18.4 billion overpayment each year associated with the earned income tax credit and we want to work with congress and are going back to see every proposal that is happened since 1975 to reduce the complexity in the credits with the majority of the issues revolving around the definition of a qualifying child. we would hope that working with congress we can come up with a better application for it and understanding and acceptance that this is a social program.\ni told the chairman, this, in my view, the stark contrast between the fact that the poorest and most honorable get audited more -- vulnerable get audited more than multimillionaires is more evidence the tax system is in favor of the wealthy.\nit sounds like senator wyden and the irs commissioner agree that there are issues with the earned income tax credit.\nyes, there are two issues, we need a much better resources, even the congressional budget office says every dollar you give the iris saves the government money because they can do enforcement and bring in more dollars but we need a radical re-and orientation of irs enforcement. it is shocking how much they are focusing on a swath of people, not struggling and do not -- there is just not a lot of money. there is a lot of money in the various loopholes and accounting sheigans undertaken by the top 1% and corporations. that is where most of the irs enforcement attention should be and it has not been recently.\nthe authors of the article got wrong was that in the audit rates of the largest companies, for example, $20 billion of cash flow per year, the audit rate is 58%. it is not as if the irs is not looking at these companies. and a large portion of the tax gap on the individual side of the $290 billion estimated, almost half of that --\n2020 democratic presidential candidate andrew yang held a rally at the lichen memorial. he talked about the effect of automation on manufacturing jobs. his proposal to give americans a $1000 per month income, and the effects on the economy. this is 20 minutes. [applause]\nthank you! thank you, washington, d.c. thank you. yes! yes! yes! thank you, washington, d.c. thank you! you all are beautiful, thank you, washington, d.c. it is incredible to be here with you. how many of you saw the cnn town hall last night? [applause] we get bigger every day and you are early adopters, you discover things early and yang is about to go mainstream. [applause] we are in the shadow of the washington monument, the lincoln memorial, i think near for the first time in eighth grade, how many of you had a trip to d.c. in eighth grade? [applause] the first time you went overnight with your classmates and were nervous and trying to find roommates and prove you have friends. you go to the lincoln memorial and it sinks in, you get it, you get the gravity of what the country went through and the man who helped bring us back together. i brought my family here to the lincoln memorial a couple of months ago for president's day. my kids are only six and three so they did not get it but -- they definitely did not get it. [laughter] but we get it. am i right? [applause] this country is going through major problems, not like civil war problems, but serious problems nonetheless. i am not a career politician. i am an entrepreneur. i am a problem solver and i am here to solve a problem that many americans have been struggling with for the past two plus years and the problem is, why is donald trump our president? [applause] if you go to the mainstream media and say, how did donald trump win in 2016? why do they say he won?\nrussia!\nwhat is number two? racism. sexism. facebook. fbi. these are the explanations we are getting, but i looked at the numbers. [applause] the reason donald trump is the president -- look at the numbers, i love the math signs and hats. make america think harder. a straight line up, the adoption of industrial robots in a voting district and the movement to donald trump. the reason he is our president today is we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in michigan, ohio, pennsylvania, wisconsin, missouri, iowa, all of the swing states he needed to win and did win. how many of you are from one of those states? you know what i'm talking about. my friends in silicon valley know what we did to manufacturing workers we will do to retail workers and fast food workers and truck drivers and on and on. i think you are agreeing with me. thank you, brother. how many of you have noticed stores closing around where you live and work? why are they closing? amazon, that is right. they're a giant vacuum cleaner, sucking up $20 million in business every year, and stores can hang on for a while but now 30% of american malls in mainstream stores are going to close in the next four years. working as a retail cashier is the most common job in the united states. the average cashier is a 39-year-old woman making between $10 and $11 per hour, and what will she do when her store closes? vote for andrew yang, that is a possibility. how many of you saw the recent google a.i. deomo that had them handling customer service calls. what do you think the timeframe is for a.i. outperforming a call center worker? what do you think? tomorrow is what he is yelling. i know when you call a company and get their company service bot, you get the same thing i do, you pound the keys until you get a human. zero, zero, human, human. i do the same thing. but we are only three years or so away from not being able to tell the difference between a bot and a human. in a few year a bot will pick up the phone and ask what they can do to help. you will be, that was delightful. we're about three years away from that but there are 2.5 million call-center workers in the united states making $14 per hour, and when a.i. can outperform one of them, it can outperform hundreds of thousands of them. i talk a lot about truck driving, the most common job, 3.5 million truck drivers, 95% men, average age is 49. so the person you think of as a truck driver is a truck driver. my friends in silicon valley are working on trucks that can drive themselves with the american reason, money. some people are screaming, yes, money. i like money, too. $168 billion in ficial incentives to automate away these truck driving jobs. do you want to bet against $168 billion year in ficial incentives? they tell me that they are five to 10 years away, testing robot trucks in the midwest right now. how will the truck drivers take it when they see robot truck drivers pass them? there are dozens of truck drivers that protested in indiana, they did a slow roll. they drove their trucks slowly on a highway and drivers were like, what's going on? why are these trucks going so slow? what were they protesting? the digital monitoring of their driving time. they didn't like being digitally monitored. there is a 14-hour restriction on driving a truck, and after 14 hours you have to turn the truck off or it gets mad at you. how are they going to react when competing against robot trucks that never need to stop? i have a feeling they will take it very poorly and only 13% of truckers are unionized today. we are talking about dramatic transformations in our economy, and i came to washington, d.c., in 2017 after donald trump won and said what will we do about the fact we are in the midst of this fundamental transformation that has brought us donald trump? this was before i was running. so they could not say \"vote yang\" yet. though i love that. that is a beautiful message. i came to this town and said, what are we going to do? what do you think the responses i got in washington, d.c., were when i said that? shout them out. go ahead. the responses i got from washington, d.c., were these -- we cannot talk about that. boo! number two, we should study that further. [boos] and we must educate and retrain americans for the jobs of the future. that sounds reasonable. again, i looked at the numbers. [applause] what do you think the success rate was for federally funded retraining programs for a manufacturing position in the midwest? it was 0% to 15%. it does not work. then i said, i did the math and we're terrible at retraining. they said to me, i guess we will get better at it. that is a washington, d.c., solution to a problem. i guess we will get better. there was one meeting i had, and i had a staffer and colleague with me and i said, if you did not verify this, you would not believe it but he said to me, andrew, you are in the wrong town. no one in this town will do anything about the problems you describe because this town is a town of followers and not leaders. [boos] and the only way to do something about it is a wave crashing down on our heads. that is the only way we will wake up. i looked at that and did not say this, but i thought, challenge accepted. [applause] now i'm running for president. how many of you saw i am poling 3% nationwide as of today? that's right still have not , and most people still have not heard of andrew yang. when they find out about me, oh, my gosh. the internet has me as fifth most likely to win the nomination. and we all know the internet is very, very smart. i am proposing, as you heard, the freedom dividend, $1,000 per month for every american adult starting at age 18. [applause] that is right. the first time you heard of that you thought these three things, there is an asian man running for president who wants to give everybody $1000 per month. [applause] and that is true. at first when you heard them you thought this literally sounds fantastic, too good to be true, gimmick. but this idea has been with us since the founding of this country. thomas payne was for it. he called it the citizen dividend. martin luther king, whose birthday we celebrate every year, he called it a guaranteed minimum income and championed it in 1967, the year before he was assassinated. milton friedman and economists signed a study that said this would be tremendous for the economy. milton friedman gets some applause. it was so mainstream it passed the house of representatives twice in 1971, and 11 years later one state adopted a dividend where everybody in the state gets between $1000 and $2000 per year, no questions asked, what state is that?\nalaska.\nhow do they find it?\noil.\nwhat is the oil of the 21st century?\ntechnology.\nwhat they are doing in alaska with oil money we can do for everyone around here with technology money. [applause]\nin alaska, they call it the oil check and they love it. we will call this the tech check and we will love it. [applause] think what would you do with $1000 per month. where would that money go?\ncollege!\nit would go to college for a lot of young people. we have to get the cost of college down. pay off debts, credit card bills. it would stay in your local communities and you would spend it on food, bills, health care, the occasional night out, and a lot of it would circulate in the towns and neighborhoods you live in. this is a trickle up economy, from people, families, and communities. [applause] this is a freedom dividend that will make a stronger and healthier and mentally healthier, and if the democratic party will talk about empowering women, there are millions of women around the country that are in abusive or exploited jobs or relationships because they lack the economic freedom to walk away, and $1000 a month would help that a great deal. am i right? [applause] we can talk about empowering women or do something about it and i choose to do something about it. [applause] this is a freedom dividend, how we can build an economy that works for us and the majority of citizens in a democracy in declaring ourselves a dividend, nothing wrong at all. we need to wake up to that power that we have as americans. you all will help us wake up the rest of the country and i thank you for that. [applause] we cannot stop there. we have to get health care off of your backs. you are all young and beautiful and in perfect health, a lot of you, you don't understand where health care now is a massive weight on millions of families and individuals where if you get sick or injured, you are more stressed out about navigating our labyrinth of a health care system than getting healthy or getting well. that is messed up and not moral and we can change it. [applause] we can move towards public option to make it so that if you get sick or injured in the richest and most advanced country in the world, you will not worry about your bills. it sounds too good to be true but i've looked at the numbers. we spend 18% of our gdp to worse results than other countries and when people say, how will you pay for it? how will you pay for it? are you kidding me? i have run companies and we spent a ton of money on health insurance. when you are running a company, it is a disincentive to hiring someone, it is a disincentive to change jobs and a disincentive to start a business. how many have wanted to start a business but thought, what will i do about health care? yeah, this is going to unleash the entrepreneurs by getting health care off rob back'sour backs. the third thing, how many of you get excited about gdp when you wake up in the morning? [applause] i talk about my wife at home with their two young boys, one is autistic, what is your work value gdp every year? zero. market value? zero. that is nonsense, the work is more vital than a lot of other work being done in our country and we will follow gdp off a cliff because self-driving trucks will be great for gdp but they will be terrible for a lot of people. how do we shift an economy that we would be excited about? we have to change the measurements. instead of gdp, this phantom number we made up almost 100 years ago, the inventor of gdp said that it is a terrible measurement for national well-being and we should never use it like that. number two he said we should include parenthood because it is so important. number three, we should not include national defense spending because it adds no economic value. [applause] we ignore all of those things and worship gdp that he made up almost 100 years ago. so instead of gdp what should we , be focusing on? how about our own health and mental health. [applause] how about how clean our air and water are? [applause] how about average income and affordability? [applause] these are the problems. gdp is at a record high but life expectancy has gotten shorter for the past three years. our life expectancy has gotten shorter because drug overdoses and suicides have overtaken vehicle deaths as cause of death for the first time in our history. you know the last time our life expectancy declined three years in a row? the great flu pandemic of 1918, the spanish flu. that is the last time our life expectancy declined three years in a row, and yet we celebrate gdp that means nothing while our people are dying earlier. we have to change the measurements to something that will reflect how we are doing, and as president, i will reflect on these numbers and present them every year at the state of the union with a powerpoint. i will be the first president to use powerpoint at the state of the union. [applause] that's right. you will get something out of the state of union instead of these bizarre performances every year. [applause] if people are trying to stand up and clap and not clap, like, what is this? it's so weird. numbers, that is right, i will show the numbers. this is how we can advance to the next stage of our economy. the number one criteria when the democrats now in the presence of candidate is who can beat donald trump. we all know here that our campaign is already getting former trump supporters, independents, republicans, libertarians, democrats, and progressives. we will build a coalition that will sweep the floor with donald trump. am i right? [applause] donald trump is our president today because he got a lot of the fundamental problems right. when he was going around saying, things are not great, and the counter was, things that are great, that was not the right response. there are real problems on the ground. he got that much right. but his solutions are the opposite of what we need. his solutions are we need to turn the clock back, we have to build a wall, we have to try to -- and time only moves in one direction. i want to do the opposite of donald trump. i want to accelerate our economy and society. i want to prepare us for the true challenges of the 21st century, and i am the right man for the job. because the opposite of donald trump is an asian man who likes math.

(music) [cheers and applause]\nwhatsapp, -- what 's up, dartmouth? it is so great to be with you guys. thank you so much. i have been reading about your leadership and your voice, and i am very honored you have been with us this afternoon to introduce me. thank you for your work. i spoke to a few of the folks outside, the fire marshal, lucky us. speaking to the folks outside, one of the things i said is, in the history of our country, i think some of the most significant advances we have made, some of the most significant changes we have made an our movement toward social justice and equality and just progress -- in our movement toward social justice and equality and just progress has been prompted and fueled by the students of america. [applause]\nand, yet again, you're doing it. you are doing it. and i cannot thank you enough. i often talk about the circumstances, my parents met when they were graduate students at uc berkeley back in the civil rights movement. i joke, me and my sister joke we grew up by a group of adults that were -- spent time marching and shouting. your kids are going to say the same thing about you guys. [laughter]\nand that is how the cycle continues. i am so happy to be with all of you today. the leaders who were in the room of every age, thank you for this. i will share a few thoughts about our campaign and what is happening around the country, and then we will pass around the mic, because i would love to hear from everyone. i tell you i fully intend to win this election. [cheers and applause]\nbut, a measure of success for me is also that at the end of this process, that we will be relevant, and relevant in the lives of the people we serve. one of the only ways i believe we can make sure that happens is that we listen as much as we talk -- more than we talk. i will share with you just a little of my thoughts. we announced our campaign several weeks ago in the place of my birth, oakland, california. we were hoping we would have a few thousand people and about 22,000 over friends showed up -- of our friends showed up, that was kind of nice. during the course of the process, people have been asking -- why are you running? so i share with them a number of reasons. one of them has to do with what i think everyone here knows. we are at an inflection point in the history of our country. this is a moment in time that is requiring each individual, and collectively, to look in the mirror and ask a question, that question being -- who are we? i think what we all know is that part of the answer to that question is we are better than this. we are better than this. [applause]\nso, this is a moment that is requiring us then to fight for the best of who we are. i think of this also as being a moment that requires that anyone who wants to be a leader must fight to restore the importance of truth and justice in our country. [applause]\nand anyone who thinks of themselves as a leader must also find to restore equal opportunity for all people in our country to succeed. [applause]\nso those are some of the reasons i am running. i guess a very personal reason is, my sister and i were raised by a mother who was five feet tall, but if you had ever met her, you would think she was seven feet tall. our mother was the kind of parent who if you overcame a -- came home -- if you ever came home complaining about something, she would look at you and say, \"what are you going to do about it?\" so i decided to run for president of the united states. [laughter] there you go. [applause]\nso, let's talk a little bit more about the importance of truth and justice. certainly in these last two years and several months, we have been talking about truth, mostly in the context of truth versus untrht -- untruth. but i ask we also consider another context, which is this. right now in our country, there are a lot of people who rightly feel a great sense of distressed -- distrust in their government, its institutions, and leaders. the thing about relationship of trust, is by its very nature, a relationship of trust is reciprocal. you give and you receive trust. one of the most important ingredients of trust is the truth. but there is a funny thing about truth. speaking truth can often make people quite uncomfortable. and for those of us who speak often behind a microphone are behind a podium, there is an incentive that we will engage in. we will make everyone feel lovely, sprinkle lovely dust all over the room, people will applaud in the job will have been done. while speaking truth, doesn't always accomplish that goal. here is the other thing about speaking truth -- yes, people may walk away from their conversation thinking they did not like particularly what i'd had to hear, but they will also walk from the -- walk away from the conversation knowing it was an honest conversation. i believe this is a moment in time where we must speak truth. so now, you all are looking at me, what are some of the truths you had in mind? i will share a few with you. if charlottesville didn't make it clear, if the tree of life synagogue could not make it clear, racism, anti-semitism, sexism, homophobia, trans-phobia are real in this country, and we must speak these truths. [cheers and applause]\nand, in speaking that truth, we must acknowledge that they are born out of hate, hate which over the last couple of years has received new fuel. we must agree that whenever and wherever that hate presents itself, we must all speak out, speak up, and we must agree that whoever is the target of that hate, they should never be made to fight alone. let's speak that truth. [applause]\nlet's speak that truth. let's speak truth. the economy of america is not working for working people. how do we know that? well, in our country today, almost half of american families cannot afford a $400 unexpected expense. $400. that could be the car breaking down, a hospital bill, $400 unexpected will completely topple that family. in american today -- in america today, in 90% of the counties in our country, if you are a minimum wage worker for working -- working full-time, you cannot afford an apartment. and our country last year, 12 million people borrowed on average $400 from the payday lender at an interest rate often above 300%. these are the truths about what is going on in our country today, which is why as 300%. president, i will reform the tax code and specifically what i propose is that for families that are making less than $100,000 a year, they will receive a $6,000 tax credit a year that they can receive at up to $500 a month which will represent all the difference between them being able to get through the end of the month or not. and, it is an interesting thing, because first of all, i will tell you the economists are talking about it is talking about that this is the most significant tax cut we will see in generations. this will lift up one into american families, two and three american pharoah -- two in three american children. there are others who will present the question -- how are you going to pay for it? [laughter]\nwell, i will tell you how we are going to pay for it. on day one, we are going to repeal that tax bill that benefits the top 1% and the greatest corporations of america. that is how we are going to pay for it. that is how we are going to pay for it. let's speak truth. we are a society that pretends to care about education. but not so much the education of other people's children. so, i have been traveling our country, i have been meeting with teachers all over our country who are working to, sometimes three jobs to pay the bills -- two, sometimes three jobs to pay the bills. money comes out of their own pockets to pay for school supplies. my first grade teacher, that bless her soul -- god bless her soul, attended my high school -- law school graduation. we'll have memories of that teacher who convinced us we were special. -- we all have memories of that teacher who convinced us we were special. we were not particularly special, but we believed them, and it put us on a path to be in a place such as this where we might be making decisions about who might be the next president of the united states. let's be clear, there are two groups of people raising our children -- parents, often with the assistance of grandparents and on sand uncles -- and aunts and uncles, and our teachers. teachers on average make 10% less than some of the college-educated professionals, which is why as president, i will implement what will be the first time in our nation, a federal investment in closing the teacher pay gap. [applause]\nso that gap on average is effectively $13,500 a year. let's be clear about $13,500 a year. in most places in our country, that represents a year's worth of mortgage statements. -- payments. it is a year's worth of grocery bills. it puts a significant dent in student loan debt. and to make a fine point on this, i firmly believe that you can judge a society based on how it treats its children. [applause]\nand one of the greatest expressions of love that a society can extend toward its children is to invest in their education, and by extension, that means investing in their teachers. let's speak truth. [applause]\nlet's speak truth. health care and access to health care should be a right to which everyone receives and not a privilege of just those who can afford it, which is why i support medicare for all. [applause]\nbecause let's be clear, in our country today, there are far too many people who do not have access to the care that can help alleviate their pain or save their lives simply because they do not have enough money in their pocket. that is immoral, and it is something we can fix, but we have got to have a commitment to do the right thing and understand this will be a reflection of who we are and what our values are as a nation. let's speak truth. [applause]\nlet's speak truth. climate change is real. [applause]\nnow, honestly guys, isn't it kind of set i had to say it that way? [laughter] and you know why i did? because there are supposed leaders in washington dc on this subject who represents an excess essential threat -- an excess essential -- and existential -- an existential threat. but these leaders are pushing science-fiction instead of collective -- instead of facts. we are in a collective peril. [applause]\nlet's speak truth. in america this evening, in places around our country, families will sit down for their weekly, nightly dinner, the parents will look at their children across the table and ask them, honey, how was your day? to which those children will respond, wasn't a good day. why, what happened? today, we had to have a drill. we learned about how we had to go and hide in a closet in case there is a mass shooter roaming the hallways of our school. why, mommy and daddy, did we have to have that drill? to which of course the answer is, well, you see, there are supposedly leaders in washington who have failed to have the courage to reject a false choice which suggests you're always -- either in table -- either in favor of the second amendment or you want to take guns away. we need reasonable gun safety laws in our country, including universal background checks and a renewal of the assault weapons ban. let's speak truth. [applause]\ni will tell you guys, honestly, i am kind of fed up with this issue. i mean, look, some people wonder why is it taking so long? what needs to happen? we all know it is not like we are waiting for a tragedy -- we have seen the worst of tragedies. and i don't even need to go down the list with you guys. we have seen the worst of tragedies. the ideas had been had. it is about people failing to have the courage to act. here is what i'm going to say, when i am elected president of the united states, i am going to give the congress 100 days to get their act together, and if they don't, i'm going to exercise executive power and do three specific things that i will share with you. one, i am going to require that anyone who sells more than five guns a year is required to do background checks. i am going to require that the atf will remove the licenses from any gun seller who violates the law. and, i am going to reverse what this administration did as it relates to fugitives for justice. they took them off the list of pivoted buyers -- of prohibited buyers. i am going to put them back on that list. that is all i will do if congress fails to act. [applause]\nand just to put a fine point on it, on the issue of gun dealers? because i have researched this issue. did you know that 90% of the guns that are used in connection with crimes are sold by 5% of the dealers? we need to crack down on this. let's speak truth. let's speak truth. in america today, there are families and parents that have to sit down with mostly their sons, sometimes their daughters, when that child turns 12 years old to have what is called \"the talk,\" wherein those parents explain, son, you may be stocked, you may be arrested -- stalked, you may be arrested, you may be chaste, you may be shut because of the color of your skin. let's speak truth that in america today we have a criminal justice system that is deeply flawed, that has been infected in many ways by bias, and that can be reformed. we should agree that in our america, no young men should fear for the safety of his life because of the color of his skin. [applause]\nlet's speak truth. let's speak truth. let's speak truth. russia interfered in the election of the president of the united states. [applause]\nand let's speak truth. we have a commander in chief, who on that subject, preferred to take the word of the russian president over the word of the american intelligence community. that we have a commander-in-chief who prefers to take the word of a north korean dictator over the word of the american intelligence community when it comes to an american student who was tortured and later died. that we have a commander-in-chief that prefers to take the word of a saudi prince over the word of the american intelligence community when it comes to a journalist who was assassinated, a journalist who had american credentials. and let's speak truth. we can no longer afford to have that commander-in-chief. [applause]\ni could go on and on with the truth. i am going to close up on this one, which i believe especially now, when there are so many powerful forces and voices in our country that are trying to sow hate and division among us. it is not only critical that we speak, but that we know and feel in our hearts and in our sole. that truth is this -- the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. let's speak that truth and know it to be truth. right. [applause]\nand here is how i think about it. it is what i call the middle of the night thought, the 3:00 in the morning thought, the witching hour, you know what i am talking about, when you wake up in the middle of the night with that thought that has been weighing on you. for the vast majority of us, when we wake up thinking that thought, it is never through the lens of the party which we are registered to vote. for the vast majority of us, when we wake up thinking that, -- that thought, it is never through the lens of a simplistic democratic a -- demographic a pollster put us in. and for the majority of us, when we wake up thinking that thought, and has to do with just one of very few things, our personal health, our children, our parents, can i get a job, keep a job, retire with dignity? can i pay off the student loans? for so many families in america, right here included in new hampshire, can i help my family member get off their opioid addiction? the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. and so, i say, as we march to 2020, let's march onto that knowing that is the strength of who we are. let's reject the stuff they are trying to sell. people who are trying to say it is us versus them. i am not buying that. i am not buying it when people are trying to say you are -- you need to have one conversation in the midwest, another one down south, another one on the coast, i am not buying that. the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. and so, i also say this -- on our march toward 2020, let us remember that one of the greatest strengths of who we are as a nation is by our very nature, we are aspirational. we are in aspirational people. we are a nation that was founded on noble ideals. the ideals that were present when we wrote the constitution of the united states and all of its amendments and the bill of rights and the declaration of independence and the words we spoke in 1770 6 -- that we are all equal and should be treated that way? we are aspirational. we are also clear that we have not reached those ideals. but the strength of who we are is that we fight to get there. and so, let's own that strength. let's own that strength in a way that we fight knowing what can be unburdened by what has been. let this be a fight that is born out of optimism. let this be a fight that we know is born out of love of country. and knowing we are better than this. that is how i think of the task before us. and my final point then is this -- this moment in time will pass, and years from now, our children, grandchildren, others will look in our eyes, each one of us, and they will ask us, where were you at that inflection moment? and part of what we are going to say is, there was this one afternoon hanging out at dartmouth. [laughter]\nbut what we are also going to be able to tell them about this moment in time -- we will be able to tell them more than just how we felt. what we are going to tell them is what we did. what action we took. that we step up. -- stepped. up. . -- that we stepped up. that we organized. we got people registered to vote. we took them to the polls, and we worked knowing the power of who we are while we are all in this. when we know the power of the people. when we know that the strength of this nation is the people, and who we are and what we see and what we know about what we can be. so years from now, we will tell them all that and we will tell them we won. thank you. [cheers and applause]\nall right. let's get some questions for the senator. right there, with the glasses.\nhi.\nwhat is your name?\nsam. you support tuition free public college, so, how would you help people who have already graduated from college relieve that student debt?\nit is one of -- it is a big area of concern for me. no student should have to fear that burden of student debt brings right now. on average, new hampshire students graduate with $32,000 in debt. back to the issue i am talking about with the teacher pay, i have met more teachers who left the profession of teaching because they simply could not afford to do the work and pay off student loans. on this point, i want that student who might be you or anyone of you, who is excelling in science and has a passion to go teach middle school students, i want you to be able to look out on your future and not be concerned about the student loan that you are facing and the cost of living and then decide instead of going to teach middle school students, i have to go and join a pharmaceutical company, or wall street because i can't afford to teach. there are so many variables that come with the issue of student loan debt that one is about a burden, a real burden, emotionally, psychologically, and ficially as well as what will end up being career decisions that will be made simply because you can't pay the bill as opposed to following your passion and doing something that will contribute to growing our society. these are the ways i think about the issue of student loan debt. first of all, yes, tuition free community college, debt-free college. next, we need to seriously understand that we have to let students refice their student loan debt. for example, i don't think it would be any of you, but a couple of generations before, if they took out their loans between 2006 in 2013, they were looking at about 7% interest rate. i am proposing that would be renegotiated to 3.5%. the other thing is we have to strengthen and actually banned the system so that the repayment schedule is going to be income-based. so, it would be proportionate to the amount of money you are making. the other thing we have to recognize that will go back to my days as being an attorney general and going after people who were defrauding consumers, is the number of predatory service providers that are out there who are servicing loans but really in a predatory way that is taking advantage of students. we need to go after them and prosecute them when they are engaged in wrong behavior. [applause]\nand then, finally, something that we also need to do in terms of the entry point is simplify the ficial aid application process. all the students here know what i am talking about. that is awful. it is just awful and it needs to be simplified so that more students can have access and know what they are getting into. those are some of my thoughts about what we need to do. thank you. [applause]\nall right. i think we have time for one more question, sorry about that. let's see. right there.\ni was just wondering, how do you plan to bridge the gap between republicans, democrats in the senate and the house?\nnatalia asked, how do we plan to bridge the gap between republicans and democrats to get something done, right? i hear you. here's the thing. i will share with you that there is bipartisan work that is happening. i am very pleased and excited to have two pieces of significant legislation that do some very important work. one, i am sponsoring a piece of legislation that would reform the money bail system in the united states. [applause]\nit is a criminal justice reform issue and an economic justice issue. there are people in our country that are sitting in jail for days, weeks, months even potentially years waiting to go to trial simply because they don't have enough money in their back pocket to pay for bail to get out while they are pending trial. i have a bill that would basically change the whole system. my cosponsor, even though we don't agree on most of anything, his name is rand paul, a republican from kentucky. he is michael cosponsor and we are working on it together. [applause] -- he is my cosponsor and we are working on it together. [applause]\nhe said, kamala, appalachia loves it. getting back to the earlier point, the best majority of us have more in common than what separates us. another bill dealing with a very big issue that deals with critical infrastructure and our country and our election and the integrity of our democracy is election security. so, i sit on the senate intelligence committee and senate homeland security committee, and we receive all kinds of information about the vulnerabilities to our national security. one of the things we know is that we are vulnerable in terms of foreign interference with our elections. i am working with a republican from oklahoma, and we have a bill that will upgrade all of the states' elections systems, and interestingly enough, the most security -- the most secure way to vote his paper. -- is paper. it would be great if the republican dealer -- republican leader would be on the floor for a boat, which has not happened, but there is bipartisan work happening. i will say this also. after the selection, it is my intention -- after this election, it is my intention to bring congress together and to say we have got to fix some things. because part of our collective frustration with what has been going on over the last couple of years is this whole situation has us staring at our belly button. the world is passing us by. we have critical issues that are being neglected in our country and we are becoming weaker because of it. let's be clear about this. ain't nobody else going to come in here and fix our problems. if we don't do it, who will? when we are looking at globalization, at the fact that we need to compete on a much bigger plane, we better get our act together. and most of the intractable issues that we must address are not even bipartisan. i would suggest to you they are nonpartisan. but we have to have real leadership at the top, and that is why i am running for president.

(music) [cheers and applause]\nwhatsapp, -- what 's up, dartmouth? it is so great to be with you guys. thank you so much. i have been reading about your leadership and your voice, and i am very honored you have been with us this afternoon to introduce me. thank you for your work. i spoke to a few of the folks outside, the fire marshal, lucky us. speaking to the folks outside, one of the things i said is, in the history of our country, i think some of the most significant advances we have made, some of the most significant changes we have made an our movement toward social justice and equality and just progress -- in our movement toward social justice and equality and just progress has been prompted and fueled by the students of america. [applause]\nand, yet again, you're doing it. you are doing it. and i cannot thank you enough. i often talk about the circumstances, my parents met when they were graduate students at uc berkeley back in the civil rights movement. i joke, me and my sister joke we grew up by a group of adults that were -- spent time marching and shouting. your kids are going to say the same thing about you guys. [laughter]\nand that is how the cycle continues. i am so happy to be with all of you today. the leaders who were in the room of every age, thank you for this. i will share a few thoughts about our campaign and what is happening around the country, and then we will pass around the mic, because i would love to hear from everyone. i tell you i fully intend to win this election. [cheers and applause]\nbut, a measure of success for me is also that at the end of this process, that we will be relevant, and relevant in the lives of the people we serve. one of the only ways i believe we can make sure that happens is that we listen as much as we talk -- more than we talk. i will share with you just a little of my thoughts. we announced our campaign several weeks ago in the place of my birth, oakland, california. we were hoping we would have a few thousand people and about 22,000 over friends showed up -- of our friends showed up, that was kind of nice. during the course of the process, people have been asking -- why are you running? so i share with them a number of reasons. one of them has to do with what i think everyone here knows. we are at an inflection point in the history of our country. this is a moment in time that is requiring each individual, and collectively, to look in the mirror and ask a question, that question being -- who are we? i think what we all know is that part of the answer to that question is we are better than this. we are better than this. [applause]\nso, this is a moment that is requiring us then to fight for the best of who we are. i think of this also as being a moment that requires that anyone who wants to be a leader must fight to restore the importance of truth and justice in our country. [applause]\nand anyone who thinks of themselves as a leader must also find to restore equal opportunity for all people in our country to succeed. [applause]\nso those are some of the reasons i am running. i guess a very personal reason is, my sister and i were raised by a mother who was five feet tall, but if you had ever met her, you would think she was seven feet tall. our mother was the kind of parent who if you overcame a -- came home -- if you ever came home complaining about something, she would look at you and say, \"what are you going to do about it?\" so i decided to run for president of the united states. [laughter] there you go. [applause]\nso, let's talk a little bit more about the importance of truth and justice. certainly in these last two years and several months, we have been talking about truth, mostly in the context of truth versus untrht -- untruth. but i ask we also consider another context, which is this. right now in our country, there are a lot of people who rightly feel a great sense of distressed -- distrust in their government, its institutions, and leaders. the thing about relationship of trust, is by its very nature, a relationship of trust is reciprocal. you give and you receive trust. one of the most important ingredients of trust is the truth. but there is a funny thing about truth. speaking truth can often make people quite uncomfortable. and for those of us who speak often behind a microphone are behind a podium, there is an incentive that we will engage in. we will make everyone feel lovely, sprinkle lovely dust all over the room, people will applaud in the job will have been done. while speaking truth, doesn't always accomplish that goal. here is the other thing about speaking truth -- yes, people may walk away from their conversation thinking they did not like particularly what i'd had to hear, but they will also walk from the -- walk away from the conversation knowing it was an honest conversation. i believe this is a moment in time where we must speak truth. so now, you all are looking at me, what are some of the truths you had in mind? i will share a few with you. if charlottesville didn't make it clear, if the tree of life synagogue could not make it clear, racism, anti-semitism, sexism, homophobia, trans-phobia are real in this country, and we must speak these truths. [cheers and applause]\nand, in speaking that truth, we must acknowledge that they are born out of hate, hate which over the last couple of years has received new fuel. we must agree that whenever and wherever that hate presents itself, we must all speak out, speak up, and we must agree that whoever is the target of that hate, they should never be made to fight alone. let's speak that truth. [applause]\nlet's speak that truth. let's speak truth. the economy of america is not working for working people. how do we know that? well, in our country today, almost half of american families cannot afford a $400 unexpected expense. $400. that could be the car breaking down, a hospital bill, $400 unexpected will completely topple that family. in american today -- in america today, in 90% of the counties in our country, if you are a minimum wage worker for working -- working full-time, you cannot afford an apartment. and our country last year, 12 million people borrowed on average $400 from the payday lender at an interest rate often above 300%. these are the truths about what is going on in our country today, which is why as 300%. president, i will reform the tax code and specifically what i propose is that for families that are making less than $100,000 a year, they will receive a $6,000 tax credit a year that they can receive at up to $500 a month which will represent all the difference between them being able to get through the end of the month or not. and, it is an interesting thing, because first of all, i will tell you the economists are talking about it is talking about that this is the most significant tax cut we will see in generations. this will lift up one into american families, two and three american pharoah -- two in three american children. there are others who will present the question -- how are you going to pay for it? [laughter]\nwell, i will tell you how we are going to pay for it. on day one, we are going to repeal that tax bill that benefits the top 1% and the greatest corporations of america. that is how we are going to pay for it. that is how we are going to pay for it. let's speak truth. we are a society that pretends to care about education. but not so much the education of other people's children. so, i have been traveling our country, i have been meeting with teachers all over our country who are working to, sometimes three jobs to pay the bills -- two, sometimes three jobs to pay the bills. money comes out of their own pockets to pay for school supplies. my first grade teacher, that bless her soul -- god bless her soul, attended my high school -- law school graduation. we'll have memories of that teacher who convinced us we were special. -- we all have memories of that teacher who convinced us we were special. we were not particularly special, but we believed them, and it put us on a path to be in a place such as this where we might be making decisions about who might be the next president of the united states. let's be clear, there are two groups of people raising our children -- parents, often with the assistance of grandparents and on sand uncles -- and aunts and uncles, and our teachers. teachers on average make 10% less than some of the college-educated professionals, which is why as president, i will implement what will be the first time in our nation, a federal investment in closing the teacher pay gap. [applause]\nso that gap on average is effectively $13,500 a year. let's be clear about $13,500 a year. in most places in our country, that represents a year's worth of mortgage statements. -- payments. it is a year's worth of grocery bills. it puts a significant dent in student loan debt. and to make a fine point on this, i firmly believe that you can judge a society based on how it treats its children. [applause]\nand one of the greatest expressions of love that a society can extend toward its children is to invest in their education, and by extension, that means investing in their teachers. let's speak truth. [applause]\nlet's speak truth. health care and access to health care should be a right to which everyone receives and not a privilege of just those who can afford it, which is why i support medicare for all. [applause]\nbecause let's be clear, in our country today, there are far too many people who do not have access to the care that can help alleviate their pain or save their lives simply because they do not have enough money in their pocket. that is immoral, and it is something we can fix, but we have got to have a commitment to do the right thing and understand this will be a reflection of who we are and what our values are as a nation. let's speak truth. [applause]\nlet's speak truth. climate change is real. [applause]\nnow, honestly guys, isn't it kind of set i had to say it that way? [laughter] and you know why i did? because there are supposed leaders in washington dc on this subject who represents an excess essential threat -- an excess essential -- and existential -- an existential threat. but these leaders are pushing science-fiction instead of collective -- instead of facts. we are in a collective peril. [applause]\nlet's speak truth. in america this evening, in places around our country, families will sit down for their weekly, nightly dinner, the parents will look at their children across the table and ask them, honey, how was your day? to which those children will respond, wasn't a good day. why, what happened? today, we had to have a drill. we learned about how we had to go and hide in a closet in case there is a mass shooter roaming the hallways of our school. why, mommy and daddy, did we have to have that drill? to which of course the answer is, well, you see, there are supposedly leaders in washington who have failed to have the courage to reject a false choice which suggests you're always -- either in table -- either in favor of the second amendment or you want to take guns away. we need reasonable gun safety laws in our country, including universal background checks and a renewal of the assault weapons ban. let's speak truth. [applause]\ni will tell you guys, honestly, i am kind of fed up with this issue. i mean, look, some people wonder why is it taking so long? what needs to happen? we all know it is not like we are waiting for a tragedy -- we have seen the worst of tragedies. and i don't even need to go down the list with you guys. we have seen the worst of tragedies. the ideas had been had. it is about people failing to have the courage to act. here is what i'm going to say, when i am elected president of the united states, i am going to give the congress 100 days to get their act together, and if they don't, i'm going to exercise executive power and do three specific things that i will share with you. one, i am going to require that anyone who sells more than five guns a year is required to do background checks. i am going to require that the atf will remove the licenses from any gun seller who violates the law. and, i am going to reverse what this administration did as it relates to fugitives for justice. they took them off the list of pivoted buyers -- of prohibited buyers. i am going to put them back on that list. that is all i will do if congress fails to act. [applause]\nand just to put a fine point on it, on the issue of gun dealers? because i have researched this issue. did you know that 90% of the guns that are used in connection with crimes are sold by 5% of the dealers? we need to crack down on this. let's speak truth. let's speak truth. in america today, there are families and parents that have to sit down with mostly their sons, sometimes their daughters, when that child turns 12 years old to have what is called \"the talk,\" wherein those parents explain, son, you may be stocked, you may be arrested -- stalked, you may be arrested, you may be chaste, you may be shut because of the color of your skin. let's speak truth that in america today we have a criminal justice system that is deeply flawed, that has been infected in many ways by bias, and that can be reformed. we should agree that in our america, no young men should fear for the safety of his life because of the color of his skin. [applause]\nlet's speak truth. let's speak truth. let's speak truth. russia interfered in the election of the president of the united states. [applause]\nand let's speak truth. we have a commander in chief, who on that subject, preferred to take the word of the russian president over the word of the american intelligence community. that we have a commander-in-chief who prefers to take the word of a north korean dictator over the word of the american intelligence community when it comes to an american student who was tortured and later died. that we have a commander-in-chief that prefers to take the word of a saudi prince over the word of the american intelligence community when it comes to a journalist who was assassinated, a journalist who had american credentials. and let's speak truth. we can no longer afford to have that commander-in-chief. [applause]\ni could go on and on with the truth. i am going to close up on this one, which i believe especially now, when there are so many powerful forces and voices in our country that are trying to sow hate and division among us. it is not only critical that we speak, but that we know and feel in our hearts and in our sole. that truth is this -- the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. let's speak that truth and know it to be truth. right. [applause]\nand here is how i think about it. it is what i call the middle of the night thought, the 3:00 in the morning thought, the witching hour, you know what i am talking about, when you wake up in the middle of the night with that thought that has been weighing on you. for the vast majority of us, when we wake up thinking that thought, it is never through the lens of the party which we are registered to vote. for the vast majority of us, when we wake up thinking that, -- that thought, it is never through the lens of a simplistic democratic a -- demographic a pollster put us in. and for the majority of us, when we wake up thinking that thought, and has to do with just one of very few things, our personal health, our children, our parents, can i get a job, keep a job, retire with dignity? can i pay off the student loans? for so many families in america, right here included in new hampshire, can i help my family member get off their opioid addiction? the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. and so, i say, as we march to 2020, let's march onto that knowing that is the strength of who we are. let's reject the stuff they are trying to sell. people who are trying to say it is us versus them. i am not buying that. i am not buying it when people are trying to say you are -- you need to have one conversation in the midwest, another one down south, another one on the coast, i am not buying that. the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. and so, i also say this -- on our march toward 2020, let us remember that one of the greatest strengths of who we are as a nation is by our very nature, we are aspirational. we are in aspirational people. we are a nation that was founded on noble ideals. the ideals that were present when we wrote the constitution of the united states and all of its amendments and the bill of rights and the declaration of independence and the words we spoke in 1770 6 -- that we are all equal and should be treated that way? we are aspirational. we are also clear that we have not reached those ideals. but the strength of who we are is that we fight to get there. and so, let's own that strength. let's own that strength in a way that we fight knowing what can be unburdened by what has been. let this be a fight that is born out of optimism. let this be a fight that we know is born out of love of country. and knowing we are better than this. that is how i think of the task before us. and my final point then is this -- this moment in time will pass, and years from now, our children, grandchildren, others will look in our eyes, each one of us, and they will ask us, where were you at that inflection moment? and part of what we are going to say is, there was this one afternoon hanging out at dartmouth. [laughter]\nbut what we are also going to be able to tell them about this moment in time -- we will be able to tell them more than just how we felt. what we are going to tell them is what we did. what action we took. that we step up. -- stepped. up. . -- that we stepped up. that we organized. we got people registered to vote. we took them to the polls, and we worked knowing the power of who we are while we are all in this. when we know the power of the people. when we know that the strength of this nation is the people, and who we are and what we see and what we know about what we can be. so years from now, we will tell them all that and we will tell them we won. thank you. [cheers and applause]\nall right. let's get some questions for the senator. right there, with the glasses.\nhi.\nwhat is your name?\nsam. you support tuition free public college, so, how would you help people who have already graduated from college relieve that student debt?\nit is one of -- it is a big area of concern for me. no student should have to fear that burden of student debt brings right now. on average, new hampshire students graduate with $32,000 in debt. back to the issue i am talking about with the teacher pay, i have met more teachers who left the profession of teaching because they simply could not afford to do the work and pay off student loans. on this point, i want that student who might be you or anyone of you, who is excelling in science and has a passion to go teach middle school students, i want you to be able to look out on your future and not be concerned about the student loan that you are facing and the cost of living and then decide instead of going to teach middle school students, i have to go and join a pharmaceutical company, or wall street because i can't afford to teach. there are so many variables that come with the issue of student loan debt that one is about a burden, a real burden, emotionally, psychologically, and ficially as well as what will end up being career decisions that will be made simply because you can't pay the bill as opposed to following your passion and doing something that will contribute to growing our society. these are the ways i think about the issue of student loan debt. first of all, yes, tuition free community college, debt-free college. next, we need to seriously understand that we have to let students refice their student loan debt. for example, i don't think it would be any of you, but a couple of generations before, if they took out their loans between 2006 in 2013, they were looking at about 7% interest rate. i am proposing that would be renegotiated to 3.5%. the other thing is we have to strengthen and actually banned the system so that the repayment schedule is going to be income-based. so, it would be proportionate to the amount of money you are making. the other thing we have to recognize that will go back to my days as being an attorney general and going after people who were defrauding consumers, is the number of predatory service providers that are out there who are servicing loans but really in a predatory way that is taking advantage of students. we need to go after them and prosecute them when they are engaged in wrong behavior. [applause]\nand then, finally, something that we also need to do in terms of the entry point is simplify the ficial aid application process. all the students here know what i am talking about. that is awful. it is just awful and it needs to be simplified so that more students can have access and know what they are getting into. those are some of my thoughts about what we need to do. thank you. [applause]\nall right. i think we have time for one more question, sorry about that. let's see. right there.\ni was just wondering, how do you plan to bridge the gap between republicans, democrats in the senate and the house?\nnatalia asked, how do we plan to bridge the gap between republicans and democrats to get something done, right? i hear you. here's the thing. i will share with you that there is bipartisan work that is happening. i am very pleased and excited to have two pieces of significant legislation that do some very important work. one, i am sponsoring a piece of legislation that would reform the money bail system in the united states. [applause]\nit is a criminal justice reform issue and an economic justice issue. there are people in our country that are sitting in jail for days, weeks, months even potentially years waiting to go to trial simply because they don't have enough money in their back pocket to pay for bail to get out while they are pending trial. i have a bill that would basically change the whole system. my cosponsor, even though we don't agree on most of anything, his name is rand paul, a republican from kentucky. he is michael cosponsor and we are working on it together. [applause] -- he is my cosponsor and we are working on it together. [applause]\nhe said, kamala, appalachia loves it. getting back to the earlier point, the best majority of us have more in common than what separates us. another bill dealing with a very big issue that deals with critical infrastructure and our country and our election and the integrity of our democracy is election security. so, i sit on the senate intelligence committee and senate homeland security committee, and we receive all kinds of information about the vulnerabilities to our national security. one of the things we know is that we are vulnerable in terms of foreign interference with our elections. i am working with a republican from oklahoma, and we have a bill that will upgrade all of the states' elections systems, and interestingly enough, the most security -- the most secure way to vote his paper. -- is paper. it would be great if the republican dealer -- republican leader would be on the floor for a boat, which has not happened, but there is bipartisan work happening. i will say this also. after the selection, it is my intention -- after this election, it is my intention to bring congress together and to say we have got to fix some things. because part of our collective frustration with what has been going on over the last couple of years is this whole situation has us staring at our belly button. the world is passing us by. we have critical issues that are being neglected in our country and we are becoming weaker because of it. let's be clear about this. ain't nobody else going to come in here and fix our problems. if we don't do it, who will? when we are looking at globalization, at the fact that we need to compete on a much bigger plane, we better get our act together. and most of the intractable issues that we must address are not even bipartisan. i would suggest to you they are nonpartisan. but we have to have real leadership at the top, and that is why i am running for president. [cheers and applause]\nthank you all very much.

[chanting bernie]\ni am bernie. anybody know who this guy is?\nyou know ben & jerry's ice cream.\ni know, i am reasonably famous that compared to the sky who gave the country jerry garcia, what can i say? ben just came in about 12 seconds ago. ben will take the stage and i will be on in a minute.\nwe worked quite sure whether i would get here on time but before bernie, i used to be the most famous guy in vermont. and i am just a happy to give that title over to bernie. ice cream is good, but a president of the united states who truly stands for justice in all its flavors? that is euphoric. [applause] you know, euphoria is a high-minded word but the reason why bernie is going to be able to transform washington is that he is down to earth. he has a vision and it is pretty simple. what would our country be like if it was actually working for the benefit of regular people instead of corporations? [applause] but he has no delusions, and that is the thing that sets bernie apart in this field. he's progressive and he's been in washington, in the house and in the senate for 30 years. he understands the cesspool of what is our political system today, and he is the guy who therefore will be able to flush the crap down the drain. [applause] you know, i don't really see bernie as a politician in the usual sense of the word. he is a fighter for justice, social, racial and economic. and he uses politics as a means to that end. you know, before bernie, i never had a mayor that represented my values or a congressman or senator, and i can't tell you how incredible it is to actually have a representative that represents you. so i just want to give you a taste of what has gotten me so excited about seeing this guy in the white house. i have been his constituent for 40 years, so i have seen how steadfast and constant he is an focused. for the last four decades he has worked to improve the quality of life regular people and those who are oppressed. way back in 1980, like before you were born, ancient history, ben & jerry's was just starting out. bernie won an improbable victory against a machine, old crony democratic mayor, and he like won by 10 votes, he became my mayor in burlington. his first act was to shut down plans to privatize the shore of lake champlain with expensive condominiums and instead, he turned it into a public park that was open to everybody. [applause] when he became my congressman, he personally took busloads of senior citizens over the border into canada so that they could get their prescription drugs at decent prices. [applause] and then more and more congressmen started doing the same thing. he cofounded the progressive caucus in the house when he was there, and it has become the largest values-based caucus. he voted against nafta before voting against nafta was cool. [applause] he voted against going to war in iraq twice. [applause] then in 2007 he defeated the richest man in vermont to become my senator. [applause] as a senator he forced the first ever audit of the federal reserve which revealed $16 trillion in near zero interest loans in the wake of the ficial crash and numerous conflicts of interest. then he led a successful effort to stop the so-called chained cpi which would have reduced the benefits that are paid to people on social security and veterans. and just last september he introduced the stop basis -- bezos act. that stands for stop bad employers are zeroing out subsidies. it requires large employers that are paying lousy wages to reimburse the federal government for the food stamps in the medicaid benefits that their employees need in order to get by. [applause] a month after he introduced that legislation, jeff bezos raised the minimum wage at amazon to $15 an hour. [applause] and now just in these last few weeks we have been reading about how it was bernie who brought republicans and democrats together to pass a resolution to get the u.s. out of the war in yemen. [applause] you know, when bernie ran for president the first time and he said he wasn't going to take any big money, i thought it was a mistake. i thought he would never be able to raise in of money for his campaign. and then i understood where he was coming from. he realized that if there weren't enough people willing to donate small amounts of money to his campaign, he didn't want to be president because once he became president, he wouldn't have the army of people that he needs to transform washington. [applause] so what do i think about bernie, the man? he has always been consistent. he has always walked the talk. this is political season. a lot of people are going to be coming by talking and saying a lot of good things, but he has done it. he is those things. he never wavers. he has a clear vision for how to make america kind again. [applause] and he continually comes up with innovative ways to do it. he is not a fancy guy. he is pretty down home, no errors -- airs, and i like his hairstyle. that is always the same too. he doesn't go with the trends, he sets the trends. small donor funded campaigns, universal health care, publicly funded colleges and universities. bernie, the trendsetter? who knew? he is already leading the country. look at all of the candidates that are following him. thanks a lot. great to be here. you guys are beautiful. [applause] (music) [applause and cheers]\nthank you. ok, let me -- good. let me thank ben for his friendship for decades and also tell you that this guy is a revolutionary in his own right. it is not only that when he and jerry greenfield, the head of ben & jerry's, the company they founded in burlington not only made great ice cream, they did something different. what they showed, and this is important, that you could run a profitable, successful business and not be a greedy anti-environmental, anti-workman. [applause] and out of what ben and jerry did, more or less, came a movement of progressive business people in this country. who said, we want to make money but we will treat our workers with dignity. we are going to treat the environment with respect. when we talk about it -- we will talk about it in a moment, family-based agriculture, they made a determined decision to buy significant amounts of milk from farmers in vermont. didn't have to do that. could have saved money doing something else, but that is what they did. they have been leading on the environment. ben, thank you very much for all you do.\nthank you, bernie. i just want to say --\nget out of here.\nhe is anxiousmr.\nto go on. i was doing an interview with someone and they were saying why are you supporting bernie? i was saying that he is a fighter for justice, and i realized, and he has this passion for justice, and i realize that yeah, i have that passion for justice. the best thing i could do to achieve justice, economic, racial, social in this country, is to support this guy for president. [applause and cheers]\nlet me, let me thank mississippi jake for the great music, let me thank mike barcelo, trying to get you guys in the campaign. michael, thank you. let me thank ashton airs and alex rodriguez and wasn't andy wolf was it? andy, he was remarkable. what i want to say is that politics is not quite as complicated as it is made out to be. the media will talk about somebody raised a lot of money today and somebody attacked somebody else, a poll showed this and that and somebody said something dumb in iowa state, hope it is not me. somebody slipped on a baa peel, and oh my god, frontpage and what is politics about? number one, it is an analysis in your own mind about what is going on in your world, society. for example front pages of the paper says the economy is booming, unemployment is down. it is down. does that mean the economy is booming for ordinary people?\nno.\nyou got to do something the media doesn't do, the congress doesn't do, most politicians don't do, go into your own hearts and minds and say what is going on in my life? you have heard from young people who made a point about one very important issue, and we will talk about a dozen of them. they said they committed a terrible crime. they tried to get a hire education -- higher education and left school in debt. the mantra of our campaign is twofold. it is think big, not small. think out-of-the-box, not what is on tv tonight. number two, it is that statement over there which is more than a bumper sticker although i think it will become a bumper sticker. that is not the, us. let's deal with those two issues. number one, donald trump will be on television and say the economy is booming, best in the history of the world, so forth and so on. your job is to say, what is going on in the economy? let's go through it now and we live in a nation, babies are being born today, people are dying today. how are we doing in terms of how we treat children in this community? are we doing great? anyone have any thoughts?\nterrible.\nthat is one way of looking at it. this is america, the wealthiest country in the history of the world. we have one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the industrialized world, 20% of our kids are in poverty in minority communities. if you look at a nation which is great, you kind of think of that nation will be treating its most vulnerable people in a great way. we surely are not treating our children in a great way we have so many in poverty. in iowa and in vermont and all of this country you have moms and dads working. when mom and dad are working and they have a child who is two or three, the child has to go to childcare. how are we going? terrible. all of you know and i suspect we have psychology majors here. [laughter] that the ages of zero through four are the most important ages for human development intellectually and emotionally. yet in america we have a situation where many working families cannot find quality, affordable childcare. you have kids sitting in front of dumb television sets with people who have not been trained adequately and in fact childcare workers make abysmal wages and don't get the respect they need. we are a nation that does not do well for young, working parents with kids nor for children in general. now the next issue, kids getting older, they go to school, most children go to public schools. i was in chicago -- i was in detroit a few weeks ago and talked to someone who said there are hundreds of vacancies in the detroit public school system. they don't pay teachers a living wage. some of you may have seen a few days ago in south carolina not the most progressive state in america, in north carolina, teachers went out and protested because their kids are not getting the education they deserve. [applause] and that is true all over this country. we have too many kids dropping out of school. now on to college, here is a great university here. what you heard, which is true all over this country, is a, we have hundreds of thousands who can't afford to even go to college and you have more and more people beginning to think, is it a good investment for me to get a higher education? maybe i should get a job after high school. you heard today and it is true all over this country, young people graduating school 30, 40 -- $30,000, $40,000 in debt. i remember talking to a doctor in burlington who graduated medical school now doing primary health care, she graduated $300,000 in debt. i was actually in des moines a few years ago, and a young woman who graduated dental school was $400,000 in debt. i ask you to think big, not small i ask you to say don't take it as something normal or sane. it is insane. you should not be punished because you want to get a higher education. [applause] here is the irony there. we live in a competitive global economy. not just for you, or you or you or you do we want an education, it is for the nation. we cannot compete effectively and in this changing technology economy unless we have the best workforce. 30 years ago we did have the best. today we do not. one of the reasons is that many people are hesitant about getting a college degree given the cost. it means a lot of people now are very nervous about what is happening -- if you graduate college or graduate school $100,000 in debt, what does it mean? tell me. it means don't live. if you get married, you and your wife decide you have $100,000, we can't afford to have kids. you can't afford to buy a house. you may not be able to buy a car. it is a tremendous burden placed on millions in this country for the crime of trying to get a higher education. getting back to the point of that the economy is presumably booming. what is the minimum wage in the state of iowa?\nis lower then. i have talked to a lot of people in iowa and across this country. does anybody -- i was on a meeting with a woman that has two kids and makes $11 an hour. do you think anybody can make it on $11 an hour with two kids?\nno.\nturns out half of the people in this country, half of the workers are living paycheck to paycheck. this is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. half of the workers are living paycheck to paycheck. what it means, and i grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck. if your car breaks down, you can't get to work. if you can't get to work you get fired. if you get fired you can't take care of your kids. do you know why there is so much stress in america? it is for reasons like that. people are struggling every single day living under enormous stress. and in the worst cases it is not only stress, it is despair. we are living in a moment in american history where, for the first time in a very long time if ever, life expectancy is going down for the third straight years. life expectancy is going down. that is because what doctors call diseases of despair. by that they mean people give up on life. they turn to drugs and opioids. they turn to alcohol, and then they turn to suicide. we are seeing that in rural parts of this country big-time. so when we talk about the economy, it is not just the relatively low on employment rate, it is what is happening to people's lives, and a lot of people are struggling. when i was your age, it was at that point possible for one worker in a family -- in those days the man, to work 40 hours a week and ring enough money -- bring in enough money to take care of the family. now you need two workers and those two don't have the kind of disposable income one person did 40 or 50 years ago. what does thinking big, not small, mean? it means analyzing what is going on around you. where do we want to go on as a nation? people disagree. what kind of nation should we become? let me tell you about the nation i think we should be. ben cohen touched on it a little bit. unlike trump, who is running a government based on racism, sexism, homophobia, religious bigotry, trying -- xenophobia -- trying to divide us up, you are different than me, your sexual orientation is different, the color of your skin is different -- i believe we bring our people together around an agenda that works for all of us. [applause and cheers] and i believe as a top priority, and i want to congratulate the young people because your generation it turns out is the most progressive generation in the history of the united states of america, and tight racist, homophobia, -- antiracist, anti- homophobia -- thank you. [applause and cheers] i also want to point out that your generation, unless we change it, and i intend to work with you to change it, will have a lower standard of living than your parents for the first time in the modern history of this country. that is right, very upset about that. what do we do? what is thinking big, not small and what is not me, us about?\nall right, good. just what i was going to say. in iowa and vermont you have people working two or three jobs because the wages they receive are not livable. you have millions of people who are paying 40%, 50%, 60% of limited incomes on housing. what do you have left over? let's go through it and talk about an agenda which speaks to the basic human rights of all americans. if you work 40 hours a week, you should not live in poverty. [applause and cheers] when i was in iowa, in the last campaign, and i came here, and i said we should raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, what my opponents said is burning, you are crazy -- bernie, you are crazy. you will have to double the minimum federal wage, can't be done. because we came to iowa and got about half the vote here on caucus night, what iowa showed americans was it wasn't such a crazy idea. h [applause and cheers] and it turns out that over the last several years, six states in this country have passed $15 an hour minimum wage. [applause and cheers] and i believe the u.s. house of representatives will do that in the next month or two. that means the vote will come to the senate, and i need you to work on senators ernst and grassley and let them know -- let them know. we will get to that in a minute.\ni think we can turn them around. tell them people can't make it on $8 or $9 an hour. first thing we are saying in an economy is we are not a poor nation. if we were a poor nation, we would take -- the wealthiest in the world. anyone who works $40 -- 40 hours a week should earn at least $15 an hour and by the way and by the way we talk about wages, we will end this nonsense that women make 80% from men -- they deserve the full dollar. [applause and cheers] and when we talk about workers rights, what you know and i know is we are not going to grow the middle class unless we grow the trade union movement in this country. [applause] we are going to make it easier for workers to join unions, not harder. and when we talk -- here is my point. i am talking about not creating a society where everybody has a big cadillac and a multimillion dollars home. we are talking about a sick human rights. in night teen 44, franklin delano roosevelt gave a state of the union address -- 1944, he gave his state of the union address where he said we have a bill of rights that is very important, guarantees freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, and we appreciate and support that. he said we have got to go further. we need the government to guarantee economic rights, not just political rights. if you get sick and you end up in a hospital and, and are bankrupt, you have a problem. what we have got to focus on is economic rights. one of the economic rights, one of the human rights we are focusing on is health care is a right, not a privilege. [applause and cheers] for the corporate media, for my friends in congress him of this seems like a radical idea. is it a radical idea?\nno.\nhow many major countries on earth do not guarantee health care? anyone know? one, you are living in it. i live 50 miles away from canada. in canada if you end up with cancer and in a hospital with massive treatment you know how much your bill is?\nzero.\nother countries have different systems. u.k., france, but essentially all of the major countries on earth understand if you are rich or whether you are poor, you should have the right to go in to a doctor's office when you are sick and not hesitate. [applause] we lose, we lose some 30,000 people a year because they hesitate to go to the doctor because they can't afford it or to bed -- the deductibles or copayments are too high. you will see a lot about the debate over medicare for all but what you should know is that the insurance companies and the drug companies and others in the health care industry have teamed together to do everything they can to defeat us. i can understand that. i can understand when insurance companies and drug companies make billions of dollars in profits every year when their ceo's make millions in compensation, they like the status quo. we are going to tell them clearly that when 34 million people have no health insurance and more are underinsured, when we play the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs at a time when the top 10 drug companies make $69 billion in profit last year, that is no longer acceptable to us and the american people. [applause and cheers] so we have an agenda some may think is radical. i don't. it speaks to the needs of working families and not just the 1%. and we have as part of a rigged economy, we have a corrupt political system. i want all of you to be thinking about that. you will see a lot of ads on television, some of it will come from the insurance companies and drug companies, some of it will come from the republican party, but understand that many of those will be paid for by the wealthiest people in this country because we have a political system made worse by the citizens united supreme court decision that allows billionaires to put in as much money as they want to allows -- elect candidates to represent the wealthy and powerful. our job in politics, in economics it is to create an economy that works for all of us. in politics it is to create a political system based on one person, one vote, not billionaires buying elections. [applause and cheers] one of the things about our corrupt political system that really, really bothers me is someone -- as someone who has run for office many times in vermont, sometimes i have lost, more times i have won, but it never occurs to me, how do i keep those people from voting? when you are seeing all over this country is massive efforts on the part of cowardly republican governors to suppress the vote. think big. if somebody is such a coward that they can't participate in a free and fair election, my view is they should get the hell out of politics and get another job. [applause and cheers] democratic politics, politics up a democracy, you will hear from different candidates, people in the democratic party, many of them good, you will hear from republicans, listen to what they have to say and you make the decisions how you want to vote, but it is grotesque and disgusting that we have republican governors and attorneys general all over this country who are making it harder for poor people, people of color and for young people to vote. that is not one american democracy is supposed to be about. what we are going to do in the white house is make a very simple position. that is if you are 18 years of age and you are a citizen of this country, you are entitled to vote, and of -- end of discussion. [applause and cheers] and when we talk about human rights, we have to talk about environmental rights as well. [applause] as i am sure you are all aware, donald trump and i have a few differences of opinion.\nbut maybe the most profound difference is that trump has maintained the myth climate change is a hoax and in fact is working overtime to make sure that we have more carbon emissions. trump also made the profound remark, you may remember a month or so ago that wind turbines cause cancer. did you hear that one? profound scientists, someone who has researched the issue for years and came up with that conclusion. my views are a little bit different. let's think big, not small. when we think big what we understand is at the end of the day, what is more important than the preservation of planet earth ? kind of significant, don't you think? [applause] and you all know what is going on. you have seen the increase in drought and letting and the weather disturbances, acidification of the ocean. here is what scientists tell us. many of you unfamiliar with this great we have 12 years, no time at all to transform our energy system or else we are going to see it reparable damage to this planet. i want you to think about that. one of those things about life is you can't be about yourself. you got to be thinking about other people and not only other people around you here. think about the kids and their kids, future generations. the native american people thought to think seven generations forward. we have 12 years of forward. we have amoral responsibility -- a moral response ability to leave this planet healthy and habitable for future generations. it means we have to have the courage to take on the fossil fuel industry. [applause and cheers] who insanely believe short-term profits are more important than the future of the planet. and in iowa you are doing a good job, 35% of electricity coming from wind, that is good. you are one of the leaders in the country but it is not hard. we know it has to be done and it is to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy is like wind, solar and other technologies. there are a couple of other issues that are out there. what is going on with our criminal justice system? it is profoundly broken. i want you all to be asking yourself how does it happen that in america we have more people in jail than any other country on earth? china, four times our size, we have more than this humid -- this communist country. we need real reform. [applause and cheers] and that means a number of things. that means investing in young people so that they have the education and the jobs they need rather than investing in more jails andthat incarceration. [applause and cheers] and you know what else it means, that we made some success, some progress on this in the last four years. and i was in iowa, i said we got to end this war on drugs and legalize marijuana. [applause and cheers] once again, once again they said it is too radical and idea, can't happen. state after state is doing for cicely that. you know why? over a long period of time, there were people arrested for possession of marijuana. occasionally there gone to jail but mostly what happened is they have a criminal record. what happens and you get right -- when you try to get a job? the employer says we got someone else in mind. so we have got to end the so-called war on drugs. we have got to end private prisons and detention centers. [applause and cheers] we have got to end cash bail. you know what that is? i didn't know this until a few years ago. as we speak there are hundreds of thousands of people in jail at this moment. you know why they are in jail, they are poor. they can't afford bail. that make sense? i don't think so. and we have to deal with another issue which trump has demonized, and that is the issue of immigration. we have 10 million undocumented people in this country. what trump is trying to do is demonize them which is what demagogues always do, pick on a minority and demonize. my view is we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship. [applause and cheers] that we need legal status for the 1.8 million young people eligible through the daca program. [applause and cheers] and that we need to treat people, in some cases where walked 1000 miles with babies, when they get to the border, we treat them with respect and dignity and do not snatch babies out of the arms of their mothers. [applause and cheers] having said all of that i want to get to what that sign means. the people's hands must be -- arms must be tired did -- holding it up. why is that an important thing?\nall together.\nyeah, but --\nthis is what i suspect no other candidate will tell you appeared i will say this about the candidates. many of them are in the senate and they are friends of mine. you have good people. i want you to hear what they have to say. i will tell you this, at the end of the day, needless to say i hope i win, they hope they win, but at the end of the day you are going to see all of the candidates coming together around the winner to make sure donald trump is defeated. [applause and cheers] but let me tell you, let me tell you what that sign -- those signs mean. it means the matter who is elected president, not the most honest, smartest, best intentioned person -- [laughter] the truth is that that person cannot do it alone. i will tell you why. this is something you don't see on tv much. that is the power structure of america is such that you have insurance companies, drug companies, wall street owning assets equivalent, six street banks owning assets equivalent to 54% of the gdp [indiscernible] six. you have fossil fuel companies making billions and lying about climate change could you have the military-industrial complex getting huge cost overruns and making incredible amounts of money at a time when we spent more than the next 10 nations combined on the military. here is the point. in order to -- what i want to do , to win the democratic nomination with your help, all right? [applause and cheers] i want to defeat donald trump him of it goes without saying. [applause and cheers] but i want to do something else, and i wouldn't be running for president if it wasn't what i want to do. i want to work with you to transform this country and our national priorities. but one person cannot do it alone. i want you all to think about american history. think about 150 years ago when workers were forced to work 15, 18 hours a day, when they could be fired arbitrarily, children working in factories and in the fields. and working people stood up and said we will not accept that anymore. we as workers want to be treated with respect and dignity. we will form unions and engage in collective bargaining because we can't do it alone. we need to come together and sit with our employer and negotiate a decent contract and decent wages. that is what the history of the trade union movement has been. think about the history of the civil rights movement. do you think it was just dr. martin luther king jr., one of the great american leaders? it wasn't him alone. he would tell you. it was millions of people coming together to save -- say we will no longer accept racism and discrimination in the united states of america. [applause and cheers] and when the american people stood up, black and white and latino stood up and said this is insane, to tell people because of the color of their skin they can't cast a ballot in alabama or mississippi, we are going to end that. they did. think about the women's movement. a little over 100 years ago women in america didn't have the right to vote. they were treated unfairly. women could do the jobs -- not do the jobs their hearts wanted to do. they couldn't get the education they wanted. that changed not by anything in washington. it said women will no longer be second-class citizens in the united states of america. [applause and cheers] and on that issue, god knows we still have a long way to go. we are seeing state after state including your state working very hard to try to deny a woman the right to control her own body. we are going to change that. same story with the gay community. i am old enough to member when people were deadly afraid to tell their friends or their parents that they were gay. people were beaten, 2 million, until finally -- humiliated until finally enough people said you have a right to love anybody regardless of their gender theory that of his results -- gender. that is a result of people standing up. so what not me, us means, not just a slogan, it is an understanding that no president can do it alone because you have got the power of wall street and the corporate media, insurance companies, drug companies, fossil fuel industries, the whole 1%. no president alone can do it. the way change happens is when millions of people stand up and look around and say, there is something wrong when three families own more wealth than the bottom half of our people. something wrong with the top 1% -- something wrong with 49% of all new income today goes to the top 1%. when people say, that ain't right, that ain't right, people begin to stand up and get involved in the process, that is the way change has always taken place, and that is the way change will take place today. in iowa, you have a very, you are in a special position. people take the first in the country caucus very seriously and go to hear all kinds of things. they think part of what they want to support. i respect that in our mostly. -- enormously. in iowa you have enormous importance. -- i always do that. never fails. last time i came to iowa, we were 3% in the polls. on -- [applause and cheers] so i am very grateful, very hateful to the people of iowa, but you have an enormous responsibility. so i hope very much given the special role iowa plays that you will get heavily involved in the political process. i hope you will participate in our campaign, which is trying to wage a political revolution in this country, not just win an election but wage a political revolution. you can do it. we need people -- the media made a big deal we raised a lot of money area that is good. we have over one million people in this country prepared to volunteer in this country. with your help, with your use of social media, knocking on doors, talking to your friends, and don't let your friends tell you politics is all bullshit and they don't have the time to get involved. you don't want to hear them moaning and groaning about student debt or $10 an hour wage, or can't afford housing, tell them to stop moaning and groaning, and get involved in the political process and transform this economy. with your help that is what we can do. thank you all very much.

[chanting bernie]\ni am bernie. anybody know who this guy is?\nyou know ben & jerry's ice cream.\ni know, i am reasonably famous that compared to the sky who gave the country jerry garcia, what can i say? ben just came in about 12 seconds ago. ben will take the stage and i will be on in a minute.\nwe worked quite sure whether i would get here on time but before bernie, i used to be the most famous guy in vermont. and i am just a happy to give that title over to bernie. ice cream is good, but a president of the united states who truly stands for justice in all its flavors? that is euphoric. [applause] you know, euphoria is a high-minded word but the reason why bernie is going to be able to transform washington is that he is down to earth. he has a vision and it is pretty simple. what would our country be like if it was actually working for the benefit of regular people instead of corporations? [applause] but he has no delusions, and that is the thing that sets bernie apart in this field. he's progressive and he's been in washington, in the house and in the senate for 30 years. he understands the cesspool of what is our political system today, and he is the guy who therefore will be able to flush the crap down the drain. [applause] you know, i don't really see bernie as a politician in the usual sense of the word. he is a fighter for justice, social, racial and economic. and he uses politics as a means to that end. you know, before bernie, i never had a mayor that represented my values or a congressman or senator, and i can't tell you how incredible it is to actually have a representative that represents you. so i just want to give you a taste of what has gotten me so excited about seeing this guy in the white house. i have been his constituent for 40 years, so i have seen how steadfast and constant he is an focused. for the last four decades he has worked to improve the quality of life regular people and those who are oppressed. way back in 1980, like before you were born, ancient history, ben & jerry's was just starting out. bernie won an improbable victory against a machine, old crony democratic mayor, and he like won by 10 votes, he became my mayor in burlington. his first act was to shut down plans to privatize the shore of lake champlain with expensive condominiums and instead, he turned it into a public park that was open to everybody. [applause] when he became my congressman, he personally took busloads of senior citizens over the border into canada so that they could get their prescription drugs at decent prices. [applause] and then more and more congressmen started doing the same thing. he cofounded the progressive caucus in the house when he was there, and it has become the largest values-based caucus. he voted against nafta before voting against nafta was cool. [applause] he voted against going to war in iraq twice. [applause] then in 2007 he defeated the richest man in vermont to become my senator. [applause] as a senator he forced the first ever audit of the federal reserve which revealed $16 trillion in near zero interest loans in the wake of the ficial crash and numerous conflicts of interest. then he led a successful effort to stop the so-called chained cpi which would have reduced the benefits that are paid to people on social security and veterans. and just last september he introduced the stop basis -- bezos act. that stands for stop bad employers are zeroing out subsidies. it requires large employers that are paying lousy wages to reimburse the federal government for the food stamps in the medicaid benefits that their employees need in order to get by. [applause] a month after he introduced that legislation, jeff bezos raised the minimum wage at amazon to $15 an hour. [applause] and now just in these last few weeks we have been reading about how it was bernie who brought republicans and democrats together to pass a resolution to get the u.s. out of the war in yemen. [applause] you know, when bernie ran for president the first time and he said he wasn't going to take any big money, i thought it was a mistake. i thought he would never be able to raise in of money for his campaign. and then i understood where he was coming from. he realized that if there weren't enough people willing to donate small amounts of money to his campaign, he didn't want to be president because once he became president, he wouldn't have the army of people that he needs to transform washington. [applause] so what do i think about bernie, the man? he has always been consistent. he has always walked the talk. this is political season. a lot of people are going to be coming by talking and saying a lot of good things, but he has done it. he is those things. he never wavers. he has a clear vision for how to make america kind again. [applause] and he continually comes up with innovative ways to do it. he is not a fancy guy. he is pretty down home, no errors -- airs, and i like his hairstyle. that is always the same too. he doesn't go with the trends, he sets the trends. small donor funded campaigns, universal health care, publicly funded colleges and universities. bernie, the trendsetter? who knew? he is already leading the country. look at all of the candidates that are following him. thanks a lot. great to be here. you guys are beautiful. [applause] (music) [applause and cheers]\nthank you. ok, let me -- good. let me thank ben for his friendship for decades and also tell you that this guy is a revolutionary in his own right. it is not only that when he and jerry greenfield, the head of ben & jerry's, the company they founded in burlington not only made great ice cream, they did something different. what they showed, and this is important, that you could run a profitable, successful business and not be a greedy anti-environmental, anti-workman. [applause] and out of what ben and jerry did, more or less, came a movement of progressive business people in this country. who said, we want to make money but we will treat our workers with dignity. we are going to treat the environment with respect. when we talk about it -- we will talk about it in a moment, family-based agriculture, they made a determined decision to buy significant amounts of milk from farmers in vermont. didn't have to do that. could have saved money doing something else, but that is what they did. they have been leading on the environment. ben, thank you very much for all you do.\nthank you, bernie. i just want to say --\nget out of here.\nhe is anxiousmr.\nto go on. i was doing an interview with someone and they were saying why are you supporting bernie? i was saying that he is a fighter for justice, and i realized, and he has this passion for justice, and i realize that yeah, i have that passion for justice. the best thing i could do to achieve justice, economic, racial, social in this country, is to support this guy for president. [applause and cheers]\nlet me, let me thank mississippi jake for the great music, let me thank mike barcelo, trying to get you guys in the campaign. michael, thank you. let me thank ashton airs and alex rodriguez and wasn't andy wolf was it? andy, he was remarkable. what i want to say is that politics is not quite as complicated as it is made out to be. the media will talk about somebody raised a lot of money today and somebody attacked somebody else, a poll showed this and that and somebody said something dumb in iowa state, hope it is not me. somebody slipped on a baa peel, and oh my god, frontpage and what is politics about? number one, it is an analysis in your own mind about what is going on in your world, society. for example front pages of the paper says the economy is booming, unemployment is down. it is down. does that mean the economy is booming for ordinary people?\nno.\nyou got to do something the media doesn't do, the congress doesn't do, most politicians don't do, go into your own hearts and minds and say what is going on in my life? you have heard from young people who made a point about one very important issue, and we will talk about a dozen of them. they said they committed a terrible crime. they tried to get a hire education -- higher education and left school in debt. the mantra of our campaign is twofold. it is think big, not small. think out-of-the-box, not what is on tv tonight. number two, it is that statement over there which is more than a bumper sticker although i think it will become a bumper sticker. that is not the, us. let's deal with those two issues. number one, donald trump will be on television and say the economy is booming, best in the history of the world, so forth and so on. your job is to say, what is going on in the economy? let's go through it now and we live in a nation, babies are being born today, people are dying today. how are we doing in terms of how we treat children in this community? are we doing great? anyone have any thoughts?\nterrible.\nthat is one way of looking at it. this is america, the wealthiest country in the history of the world. we have one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the industrialized world, 20% of our kids are in poverty in minority communities. if you look at a nation which is great, you kind of think of that nation will be treating its most vulnerable people in a great way. we surely are not treating our children in a great way we have so many in poverty. in iowa and in vermont and all of this country you have moms and dads working. when mom and dad are working and they have a child who is two or three, the child has to go to childcare. how are we going? terrible. all of you know and i suspect we have psychology majors here. [laughter] that the ages of zero through four are the most important ages for human development intellectually and emotionally. yet in america we have a situation where many working families cannot find quality, affordable childcare. you have kids sitting in front of dumb television sets with people who have not been trained adequately and in fact childcare workers make abysmal wages and don't get the respect they need. we are a nation that does not do well for young, working parents with kids nor for children in general. now the next issue, kids getting older, they go to school, most children go to public schools. i was in chicago -- i was in detroit a few weeks ago and talked to someone who said there are hundreds of vacancies in the detroit public school system. they don't pay teachers a living wage. some of you may have seen a few days ago in south carolina not the most progressive state in america, in north carolina, teachers went out and protested because their kids are not getting the education they deserve. [applause] and that is true all over this country. we have too many kids dropping out of school. now on to college, here is a great university here. what you heard, which is true all over this country, is a, we have hundreds of thousands who can't afford to even go to college and you have more and more people beginning to think, is it a good investment for me to get a higher education? maybe i should get a job after high school. you heard today and it is true all over this country, young people graduating school 30, 40 -- $30,000, $40,000 in debt. i remember talking to a doctor in burlington who graduated medical school now doing primary health care, she graduated $300,000 in debt. i was actually in des moines a few years ago, and a young woman who graduated dental school was $400,000 in debt. i ask you to think big, not small i ask you to say don't take it as something normal or sane. it is insane. you should not be punished because you want to get a higher education. [applause] here is the irony there. we live in a competitive global economy. not just for you, or you or you or you do we want an education, it is for the nation. we cannot compete effectively and in this changing technology economy unless we have the best workforce. 30 years ago we did have the best. today we do not. one of the reasons is that many people are hesitant about getting a college degree given the cost. it means a lot of people now are very nervous about what is happening -- if you graduate college or graduate school $100,000 in debt, what does it mean? tell me. it means don't live. if you get married, you and your wife decide you have $100,000, we can't afford to have kids. you can't afford to buy a house. you may not be able to buy a car. it is a tremendous burden placed on millions in this country for the crime of trying to get a higher education. getting back to the point of that the economy is presumably booming. what is the minimum wage in the state of iowa?\nis lower then. i have talked to a lot of people in iowa and across this country. does anybody -- i was on a meeting with a woman that has two kids and makes $11 an hour. do you think anybody can make it on $11 an hour with two kids?\nno.\nturns out half of the people in this country, half of the workers are living paycheck to paycheck. this is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. half of the workers are living paycheck to paycheck. what it means, and i grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck. if your car breaks down, you can't get to work. if you can't get to work you get fired. if you get fired you can't take care of your kids. do you know why there is so much stress in america? it is for reasons like that. people are struggling every single day living under enormous stress. and in the worst cases it is not only stress, it is despair. we are living in a moment in american history where, for the first time in a very long time if ever, life expectancy is going down for the third straight years. life expectancy is going down. that is because what doctors call diseases of despair. by that they mean people give up on life. they turn to drugs and opioids. they turn to alcohol, and then they turn to suicide. we are seeing that in rural parts of this country big-time. so when we talk about the economy, it is not just the relatively low on employment rate, it is what is happening to people's lives, and a lot of people are struggling. when i was your age, it was at that point possible for one worker in a family -- in those days the man, to work 40 hours a week and ring enough money -- bring in enough money to take care of the family. now you need two workers and those two don't have the kind of disposable income one person did 40 or 50 years ago. what does thinking big, not small, mean? it means analyzing what is going on around you. where do we want to go on as a nation? people disagree. what kind of nation should we become? let me tell you about the nation i think we should be. ben cohen touched on it a little bit. unlike trump, who is running a government based on racism, sexism, homophobia, religious bigotry, trying -- xenophobia -- trying to divide us up, you are different than me, your sexual orientation is different, the color of your skin is different -- i believe we bring our people together around an agenda that works for all of us. [applause and cheers] and i believe as a top priority, and i want to congratulate the young people because your generation it turns out is the most progressive generation in the history of the united states of america, and tight racist, homophobia, -- antiracist, anti- homophobia -- thank you. [applause and cheers] i also want to point out that your generation, unless we change it, and i intend to work with you to change it, will have a lower standard of living than your parents for the first time in the modern history of this country. that is right, very upset about that. what do we do? what is thinking big, not small and what is not me, us about?\nall right, good. just what i was going to say. in iowa and vermont you have people working two or three jobs because the wages they receive are not livable. you have millions of people who are paying 40%, 50%, 60% of limited incomes on housing. what do you have left over? let's go through it and talk about an agenda which speaks to the basic human rights of all americans. if you work 40 hours a week, you should not live in poverty. [applause and cheers] when i was in iowa, in the last campaign, and i came here, and i said we should raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, what my opponents said is burning, you are crazy -- bernie, you are crazy. you will have to double the minimum federal wage, can't be done. because we came to iowa and got about half the vote here on caucus night, what iowa showed americans was it wasn't such a crazy idea. h [applause and cheers] and it turns out that over the last several years, six states in this country have passed $15 an hour minimum wage. [applause and cheers] and i believe the u.s. house of representatives will do that in the next month or two. that means the vote will come to the senate, and i need you to work on senators ernst and grassley and let them know -- let them know. we will get to that in a minute.\ni think we can turn them around. tell them people can't make it on $8 or $9 an hour. first thing we are saying in an economy is we are not a poor nation. if we were a poor nation, we would take -- the wealthiest in the world. anyone who works $40 -- 40 hours a week should earn at least $15 an hour and by the way and by the way we talk about wages, we will end this nonsense that women make 80% from men -- they deserve the full dollar. [applause and cheers] and when we talk about workers rights, what you know and i know is we are not going to grow the middle class unless we grow the trade union movement in this country. [applause] we are going to make it easier for workers to join unions, not harder. and when we talk -- here is my point. i am talking about not creating a society where everybody has a big cadillac and a multimillion dollars home. we are talking about a sick human rights. in night teen 44, franklin delano roosevelt gave a state of the union address -- 1944, he gave his state of the union address where he said we have a bill of rights that is very important, guarantees freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, and we appreciate and support that. he said we have got to go further. we need the government to guarantee economic rights, not just political rights. if you get sick and you end up in a hospital and, and are bankrupt, you have a problem. what we have got to focus on is economic rights. one of the economic rights, one of the human rights we are focusing on is health care is a right, not a privilege. [applause and cheers] for the corporate media, for my friends in congress him of this seems like a radical idea. is it a radical idea?\nno.\nhow many major countries on earth do not guarantee health care? anyone know? one, you are living in it. i live 50 miles away from canada. in canada if you end up with cancer and in a hospital with massive treatment you know how much your bill is?\nzero.\nother countries have different systems. u.k., france, but essentially all of the major countries on earth understand if you are rich or whether you are poor, you should have the right to go in to a doctor's office when you are sick and not hesitate. [applause] we lose, we lose some 30,000 people a year because they hesitate to go to the doctor because they can't afford it or to bed -- the deductibles or copayments are too high. you will see a lot about the debate over medicare for all but what you should know is that the insurance companies and the drug companies and others in the health care industry have teamed together to do everything they can to defeat us. i can understand that. i can understand when insurance companies and drug companies make billions of dollars in profits every year when their ceo's make millions in compensation, they like the status quo. we are going to tell them clearly that when 34 million people have no health insurance and more are underinsured, when we play the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs at a time when the top 10 drug companies make $69 billion in profit last year, that is no longer acceptable to us and the american people. [applause and cheers] so we have an agenda some may think is radical. i don't. it speaks to the needs of working families and not just the 1%. and we have as part of a rigged economy, we have a corrupt political system. i want all of you to be thinking about that. you will see a lot of ads on television, some of it will come from the insurance companies and drug companies, some of it will come from the republican party, but understand that many of those will be paid for by the wealthiest people in this country because we have a political system made worse by the citizens united supreme court decision that allows billionaires to put in as much money as they want to allows -- elect candidates to represent the wealthy and powerful. our job in politics, in economics it is to create an economy that works for all of us. in politics it is to create a political system based on one person, one vote, not billionaires buying elections. [applause and cheers] one of the things about our corrupt political system that really, really bothers me is someone -- as someone who has run for office many times in vermont, sometimes i have lost, more times i have won, but it never occurs to me, how do i keep those people from voting? when you are seeing all over this country is massive efforts on the part of cowardly republican governors to suppress the vote. think big. if somebody is such a coward that they can't participate in a free and fair election, my view is they should get the hell out of politics and get another job. [applause and cheers] democratic politics, politics up a democracy, you will hear from different candidates, people in the democratic party, many of them good, you will hear from republicans, listen to what they have to say and you make the decisions how you want to vote, but it is grotesque and disgusting that we have republican governors and attorneys general all over this country who are making it harder for poor people, people of color and for young people to vote. that is not one american democracy is supposed to be about. what we are going to do in the white house is make a very simple position. that is if you are 18 years of age and you are a citizen of this country, you are entitled to vote, and of -- end of discussion. [applause and cheers] and when we talk about human rights, we have to talk about environmental rights as well. [applause] as i am sure you are all aware, donald trump and i have a few differences of opinion.\nbut maybe the most profound difference is that trump has maintained the myth climate change is a hoax and in fact is working overtime to make sure that we have more carbon emissions. trump also made the profound remark, you may remember a month or so ago that wind turbines cause cancer. did you hear that one? profound scientists, someone who has researched the issue for years and came up with that conclusion. my views are a little bit different. let's think big, not small. when we think big what we understand is at the end of the day, what is more important than the preservation of planet earth ? kind of significant, don't you think? [applause] and you all know what is going on. you have seen the increase in drought and letting and the weather disturbances, acidification of the ocean. here is what scientists tell us. many of you unfamiliar with this great we have 12 years, no time at all to transform our energy system or else we are going to see it reparable damage to this planet. i want you to think about that. one of those things about life is you can't be about yourself. you got to be thinking about other people and not only other people around you here. think about the kids and their kids, future generations. the native american people thought to think seven generations forward. we have 12 years of forward. we have amoral responsibility -- a moral response ability to leave this planet healthy and habitable for future generations. it means we have to have the courage to take on the fossil fuel industry. [applause and cheers] who insanely believe short-term profits are more important than the future of the planet. and in iowa you are doing a good job, 35% of electricity coming from wind, that is good. you are one of the leaders in the country but it is not hard. we know it has to be done and it is to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy is like wind, solar and other technologies. there are a couple of other issues that are out there. what is going on with our criminal justice system? it is profoundly broken. i want you all to be asking yourself how does it happen that in america we have more people in jail than any other country on earth? china, four times our size, we have more than this humid -- this communist country. we need real reform. [applause and cheers] and that means a number of things. that means investing in young people so that they have the education and the jobs they need rather than investing in more jails andthat incarceration. [applause and cheers] and you know what else it means, that we made some success, some progress on this in the last four years. and i was in iowa, i said we got to end this war on drugs and legalize marijuana. [applause and cheers] once again, once again they said it is too radical and idea, can't happen. state after state is doing for cicely that. you know why? over a long period of time, there were people arrested for possession of marijuana. occasionally there gone to jail but mostly what happened is they have a criminal record. what happens and you get right -- when you try to get a job? the employer says we got someone else in mind. so we have got to end the so-called war on drugs. we have got to end private prisons and detention centers. [applause and cheers] we have got to end cash bail. you know what that is? i didn't know this until a few years ago. as we speak there are hundreds of thousands of people in jail at this moment. you know why they are in jail, they are poor. they can't afford bail. that make sense? i don't think so. and we have to deal with another issue which trump has demonized, and that is the issue of immigration. we have 10 million undocumented people in this country. what trump is trying to do is demonize them which is what demagogues always do, pick on a minority and demonize. my view is we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship. [applause and cheers] that we need legal status for the 1.8 million young people eligible through the daca program. [applause and cheers] and that we need to treat people, in some cases where walked 1000 miles with babies, when they get to the border, we treat them with respect and dignity and do not snatch babies out of the arms of their mothers. [applause and cheers] having said all of that i want to get to what that sign means. the people's hands must be -- arms must be tired did -- holding it up. why is that an important thing?\nall together.\nyeah, but --\nthis is what i suspect no other candidate will tell you appeared i will say this about the candidates. many of them are in the senate and they are friends of mine. you have good people. i want you to hear what they have to say. i will tell you this, at the end of the day, needless to say i hope i win, they hope they win, but at the end of the day you are going to see all of the candidates coming together around the winner to make sure donald trump is defeated. [applause and cheers] but let me tell you, let me tell you what that sign -- those signs mean. it means the matter who is elected president, not the most honest, smartest, best intentioned person -- [laughter] the truth is that that person cannot do it alone. i will tell you why. this is something you don't see on tv much. that is the power structure of america is such that you have insurance companies, drug companies, wall street owning assets equivalent, six street banks owning assets equivalent to 54% of the gdp [indiscernible] six. you have fossil fuel companies making billions and lying about climate change could you have the military-industrial complex getting huge cost overruns and making incredible amounts of money at a time when we spent more than the next 10 nations combined on the military. here is the point. in order to -- what i want to do , to win the democratic nomination with your help, all right? [applause and cheers] i want to defeat donald trump him of it goes without saying. [applause and cheers] but i want to do something else, and i wouldn't be running for president if it wasn't what i want to do. i want to work with you to transform this country and our national priorities. but one person cannot do it alone. i want you all to think about american history. think about 150 years ago when workers were forced to work 15, 18 hours a day, when they could be fired arbitrarily, children working in factories and in the fields. and working people stood up and said we will not accept that anymore. we as workers want to be treated with respect and dignity. we will form unions and engage in collective bargaining because we can't do it alone. we need to come together and sit with our employer and negotiate a decent contract and decent wages. that is what the history of the trade union movement has been. think about the history of the civil rights movement. do you think it was just dr. martin luther king jr., one of the great american leaders? it wasn't him alone. he would tell you. it was millions of people coming together to save -- say we will no longer accept racism and discrimination in the united states of america. [applause and cheers] and when the american people stood up, black and white and latino stood up and said this is insane, to tell people because of the color of their skin they can't cast a ballot in alabama or mississippi, we are going to end that. they did. think about the women's movement. a little over 100 years ago women in america didn't have the right to vote. they were treated unfairly. women could do the jobs -- not do the jobs their hearts wanted to do. they couldn't get the education they wanted. that changed not by anything in washington. it said women will no longer be second-class citizens in the united states of america. [applause and cheers] and on that issue, god knows we still have a long way to go. we are seeing state after state including your state working very hard to try to deny a woman the right to control her own body. we are going to change that. same story with the gay community. i am old enough to member when people were deadly afraid to tell their friends or their parents that they were gay. people were beaten, 2 million, until finally -- humiliated until finally enough people said you have a right to love anybody regardless of their gender theory that of his results -- gender. that is a result of people standing up. so what not me, us means, not just a slogan, it is an understanding that no president can do it alone because you have got the power of wall street and the corporate media, insurance companies, drug companies, fossil fuel industries, the whole 1%. no president alone can do it. the way change happens is when millions of people stand up and look around and say, there is something wrong when three families own more wealth than the bottom half of our people. something wrong with the top 1% -- something wrong with 49% of all new income today goes to the top 1%. when people say, that ain't right, that ain't right, people begin to stand up and get involved in the process, that is the way change has always taken place, and that is the way change will take place today. in iowa, you have a very, you are in a special position. people take the first in the country caucus very seriously and go to hear all kinds of things. they think part of what they want to support. i respect that in our mostly. -- enormously. in iowa you have enormous importance. -- i always do that. never fails. last time i came to iowa, we were 3% in the polls. on -- [applause and cheers] so i am very grateful, very hateful to the people of iowa, but you have an enormous responsibility. so i hope very much given the special role iowa plays that you will get heavily involved in the political process. i hope you will participate in our campaign, which is trying to wage a political revolution in this country, not just win an election but wage a political revolution. you can do it. we need people -- the media made a big deal we raised a lot of money area that is good. we have over one million people in this country prepared to volunteer in this country. with your help, with your use of social media, knocking on doors, talking to your friends, and don't let your friends tell you politics is all bullshit and they don't have the time to get involved. you don't want to hear them moaning and groaning about student debt or $10 an hour wage, or can't afford housing, tell them to stop moaning and groaning, and get involved in the political process and transform this economy. with your help that is what we can do. thank you all very much. [applause and cheers] (music) [captioning performed by the national captioning institute, which is responsible for its caption content and accuracy. visit ncicap.org] [captions copyright national cable satellite corp. 2019]", "group_name": "Sanders", "color": "#FF2311", "group_id": 1, "name": "Bldg Perry, IA"}, "geometry": {"coordinates": [-94.0955769, 41.8423595], "type": "Point"}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"headline": "2019-05-04 || Sanders || Ames, IA", "month": "May", "article": "Ames, IA i hate to let you down. this is not bernie. [chanting bernie]\ni am bernie. anybody know who this guy is?\nyou know ben & jerry's ice cream.\ni know, i am reasonably famous that compared to the sky who gave the country jerry garcia, what can i say? ben just came in about 12 seconds ago. ben will take the stage and i will be on in a minute.\nwe worked quite sure whether i would get here on time but before bernie, i used to be the most famous guy in vermont. and i am just a happy to give that title over to bernie. ice cream is good, but a president of the united states who truly stands for justice in all its flavors? that is euphoric. [applause] you know, euphoria is a high-minded word but the reason why bernie is going to be able to transform washington is that he is down to earth. he has a vision and it is pretty simple. what would our country be like if it was actually working for the benefit of regular people instead of corporations? [applause] but he has no delusions, and that is the thing that sets bernie apart in this field. he's progressive and he's been in washington, in the house and in the senate for 30 years. he understands the cesspool of what is our political system today, and he is the guy who therefore will be able to flush the crap down the drain. [applause] you know, i don't really see bernie as a politician in the usual sense of the word. he is a fighter for justice, social, racial and economic. and he uses politics as a means to that end. you know, before bernie, i never had a mayor that represented my values or a congressman or senator, and i can't tell you how incredible it is to actually have a representative that represents you. so i just want to give you a taste of what has gotten me so excited about seeing this guy in the white house. i have been his constituent for 40 years, so i have seen how steadfast and constant he is an focused. for the last four decades he has worked to improve the quality of life regular people and those who are oppressed. way back in 1980, like before you were born, ancient history, ben & jerry's was just starting out. bernie won an improbable victory against a machine, old crony democratic mayor, and he like won by 10 votes, he became my mayor in burlington. his first act was to shut down plans to privatize the shore of lake champlain with expensive condominiums and instead, he turned it into a public park that was open to everybody. [applause] when he became my congressman, he personally took busloads of senior citizens over the border into canada so that they could get their prescription drugs at decent prices. [applause] and then more and more congressmen started doing the same thing. he cofounded the progressive caucus in the house when he was there, and it has become the largest values-based caucus. he voted against nafta before voting against nafta was cool. [applause] he voted against going to war in iraq twice. [applause] then in 2007 he defeated the richest man in vermont to become my senator. [applause] as a senator he forced the first ever audit of the federal reserve which revealed $16 trillion in near zero interest loans in the wake of the ficial crash and numerous conflicts of interest. then he led a successful effort to stop the so-called chained cpi which would have reduced the benefits that are paid to people on social security and veterans. and just last september he introduced the stop basis -- bezos act. that stands for stop bad employers are zeroing out subsidies. it requires large employers that are paying lousy wages to reimburse the federal government for the food stamps in the medicaid benefits that their employees need in order to get by. [applause] a month after he introduced that legislation, jeff bezos raised the minimum wage at amazon to $15 an hour. [applause] and now just in these last few weeks we have been reading about how it was bernie who brought republicans and democrats together to pass a resolution to get the u.s. out of the war in yemen. [applause] you know, when bernie ran for president the first time and he said he wasn't going to take any big money, i thought it was a mistake. i thought he would never be able to raise in of money for his campaign. and then i understood where he was coming from. he realized that if there weren't enough people willing to donate small amounts of money to his campaign, he didn't want to be president because once he became president, he wouldn't have the army of people that he needs to transform washington. [applause] so what do i think about bernie, the man? he has always been consistent. he has always walked the talk. this is political season. a lot of people are going to be coming by talking and saying a lot of good things, but he has done it. he is those things. he never wavers. he has a clear vision for how to make america kind again. [applause] and he continually comes up with innovative ways to do it. he is not a fancy guy. he is pretty down home, no errors -- airs, and i like his hairstyle. that is always the same too. he doesn't go with the trends, he sets the trends. small donor funded campaigns, universal health care, publicly funded colleges and universities. bernie, the trendsetter? who knew? he is already leading the country. look at all of the candidates that are following him. thanks a lot. great to be here. you guys are beautiful. [applause] (music) [applause and cheers]\nthank you. ok, let me -- good. let me thank ben for his friendship for decades and also tell you that this guy is a revolutionary in his own right. it is not only that when he and jerry greenfield, the head of ben & jerry's, the company they founded in burlington not only made great ice cream, they did something different. what they showed, and this is important, that you could run a profitable, successful business and not be a greedy anti-environmental, anti-workman. [applause] and out of what ben and jerry did, more or less, came a movement of progressive business people in this country. who said, we want to make money but we will treat our workers with dignity. we are going to treat the environment with respect. when we talk about it -- we will talk about it in a moment, family-based agriculture, they made a determined decision to buy significant amounts of milk from farmers in vermont. didn't have to do that. could have saved money doing something else, but that is what they did. they have been leading on the environment. ben, thank you very much for all you do.\nthank you, bernie. i just want to say --\nget out of here.\nhe is anxiousmr.\nto go on. i was doing an interview with someone and they were saying why are you supporting bernie? i was saying that he is a fighter for justice, and i realized, and he has this passion for justice, and i realize that yeah, i have that passion for justice. the best thing i could do to achieve justice, economic, racial, social in this country, is to support this guy for president. [applause and cheers]\nlet me, let me thank mississippi jake for the great music, let me thank mike barcelo, trying to get you guys in the campaign. michael, thank you. let me thank ashton airs and alex rodriguez and wasn't andy wolf was it? andy, he was remarkable. what i want to say is that politics is not quite as complicated as it is made out to be. the media will talk about somebody raised a lot of money today and somebody attacked somebody else, a poll showed this and that and somebody said something dumb in iowa state, hope it is not me. somebody slipped on a baa peel, and oh my god, frontpage and what is politics about? number one, it is an analysis in your own mind about what is going on in your world, society. for example front pages of the paper says the economy is booming, unemployment is down. it is down. does that mean the economy is booming for ordinary people?\nno.\nyou got to do something the media doesn't do, the congress doesn't do, most politicians don't do, go into your own hearts and minds and say what is going on in my life? you have heard from young people who made a point about one very important issue, and we will talk about a dozen of them. they said they committed a terrible crime. they tried to get a hire education -- higher education and left school in debt. the mantra of our campaign is twofold. it is think big, not small. think out-of-the-box, not what is on tv tonight. number two, it is that statement over there which is more than a bumper sticker although i think it will become a bumper sticker. that is not the, us. let's deal with those two issues. number one, donald trump will be on television and say the economy is booming, best in the history of the world, so forth and so on. your job is to say, what is going on in the economy? let's go through it now and we live in a nation, babies are being born today, people are dying today. how are we doing in terms of how we treat children in this community? are we doing great? anyone have any thoughts?\nterrible.\nthat is one way of looking at it. this is america, the wealthiest country in the history of the world. we have one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the industrialized world, 20% of our kids are in poverty in minority communities. if you look at a nation which is great, you kind of think of that nation will be treating its most vulnerable people in a great way. we surely are not treating our children in a great way we have so many in poverty. in iowa and in vermont and all of this country you have moms and dads working. when mom and dad are working and they have a child who is two or three, the child has to go to childcare. how are we going? terrible. all of you know and i suspect we have psychology majors here. [laughter] that the ages of zero through four are the most important ages for human development intellectually and emotionally. yet in america we have a situation where many working families cannot find quality, affordable childcare. you have kids sitting in front of dumb television sets with people who have not been trained adequately and in fact childcare workers make abysmal wages and don't get the respect they need. we are a nation that does not do well for young, working parents with kids nor for children in general. now the next issue, kids getting older, they go to school, most children go to public schools. i was in chicago -- i was in detroit a few weeks ago and talked to someone who said there are hundreds of vacancies in the detroit public school system. they don't pay teachers a living wage. some of you may have seen a few days ago in south carolina not the most progressive state in america, in north carolina, teachers went out and protested because their kids are not getting the education they deserve. [applause] and that is true all over this country. we have too many kids dropping out of school. now on to college, here is a great university here. what you heard, which is true all over this country, is a, we have hundreds of thousands who can't afford to even go to college and you have more and more people beginning to think, is it a good investment for me to get a higher education? maybe i should get a job after high school. you heard today and it is true all over this country, young people graduating school 30, 40 -- $30,000, $40,000 in debt. i remember talking to a doctor in burlington who graduated medical school now doing primary health care, she graduated $300,000 in debt. i was actually in des moines a few years ago, and a young woman who graduated dental school was $400,000 in debt. i ask you to think big, not small i ask you to say don't take it as something normal or sane. it is insane. you should not be punished because you want to get a higher education. [applause] here is the irony there. we live in a competitive global economy. not just for you, or you or you or you do we want an education, it is for the nation. we cannot compete effectively and in this changing technology economy unless we have the best workforce. 30 years ago we did have the best. today we do not. one of the reasons is that many people are hesitant about getting a college degree given the cost. it means a lot of people now are very nervous about what is happening -- if you graduate college or graduate school $100,000 in debt, what does it mean? tell me. it means don't live. if you get married, you and your wife decide you have $100,000, we can't afford to have kids. you can't afford to buy a house. you may not be able to buy a car. it is a tremendous burden placed on millions in this country for the crime of trying to get a higher education. getting back to the point of that the economy is presumably booming. what is the minimum wage in the state of iowa?\nis lower then. i have talked to a lot of people in iowa and across this country. does anybody -- i was on a meeting with a woman that has two kids and makes $11 an hour. do you think anybody can make it on $11 an hour with two kids?\nno.\nturns out half of the people in this country, half of the workers are living paycheck to paycheck. this is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. half of the workers are living paycheck to paycheck. what it means, and i grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck. if your car breaks down, you can't get to work. if you can't get to work you get fired. if you get fired you can't take care of your kids. do you know why there is so much stress in america? it is for reasons like that. people are struggling every single day living under enormous stress. and in the worst cases it is not only stress, it is despair. we are living in a moment in american history where, for the first time in a very long time if ever, life expectancy is going down for the third straight years. life expectancy is going down. that is because what doctors call diseases of despair. by that they mean people give up on life. they turn to drugs and opioids. they turn to alcohol, and then they turn to suicide. we are seeing that in rural parts of this country big-time. so when we talk about the economy, it is not just the relatively low on employment rate, it is what is happening to people's lives, and a lot of people are struggling. when i was your age, it was at that point possible for one worker in a family -- in those days the man, to work 40 hours a week and ring enough money -- bring in enough money to take care of the family. now you need two workers and those two don't have the kind of disposable income one person did 40 or 50 years ago. what does thinking big, not small, mean? it means analyzing what is going on around you. where do we want to go on as a nation? people disagree. what kind of nation should we become? let me tell you about the nation i think we should be. ben cohen touched on it a little bit. unlike trump, who is running a government based on racism, sexism, homophobia, religious bigotry, trying -- xenophobia -- trying to divide us up, you are different than me, your sexual orientation is different, the color of your skin is different -- i believe we bring our people together around an agenda that works for all of us. [applause and cheers] and i believe as a top priority, and i want to congratulate the young people because your generation it turns out is the most progressive generation in the history of the united states of america, and tight racist, homophobia, -- antiracist, anti- homophobia -- thank you. [applause and cheers] i also want to point out that your generation, unless we change it, and i intend to work with you to change it, will have a lower standard of living than your parents for the first time in the modern history of this country. that is right, very upset about that. what do we do? what is thinking big, not small and what is not me, us about?\nall right, good. just what i was going to say. in iowa and vermont you have people working two or three jobs because the wages they receive are not livable. you have millions of people who are paying 40%, 50%, 60% of limited incomes on housing. what do you have left over? let's go through it and talk about an agenda which speaks to the basic human rights of all americans. if you work 40 hours a week, you should not live in poverty. [applause and cheers] when i was in iowa, in the last campaign, and i came here, and i said we should raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, what my opponents said is burning, you are crazy -- bernie, you are crazy. you will have to double the minimum federal wage, can't be done. because we came to iowa and got about half the vote here on caucus night, what iowa showed americans was it wasn't such a crazy idea. h [applause and cheers] and it turns out that over the last several years, six states in this country have passed $15 an hour minimum wage. [applause and cheers] and i believe the u.s. house of representatives will do that in the next month or two. that means the vote will come to the senate, and i need you to work on senators ernst and grassley and let them know -- let them know. we will get to that in a minute.\ni think we can turn them around. tell them people can't make it on $8 or $9 an hour. first thing we are saying in an economy is we are not a poor nation. if we were a poor nation, we would take -- the wealthiest in the world. anyone who works $40 -- 40 hours a week should earn at least $15 an hour and by the way and by the way we talk about wages, we will end this nonsense that women make 80% from men -- they deserve the full dollar. [applause and cheers] and when we talk about workers rights, what you know and i know is we are not going to grow the middle class unless we grow the trade union movement in this country. [applause] we are going to make it easier for workers to join unions, not harder. and when we talk -- here is my point. i am talking about not creating a society where everybody has a big cadillac and a multimillion dollars home. we are talking about a sick human rights. in night teen 44, franklin delano roosevelt gave a state of the union address -- 1944, he gave his state of the union address where he said we have a bill of rights that is very important, guarantees freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, and we appreciate and support that. he said we have got to go further. we need the government to guarantee economic rights, not just political rights. if you get sick and you end up in a hospital and, and are bankrupt, you have a problem. what we have got to focus on is economic rights. one of the economic rights, one of the human rights we are focusing on is health care is a right, not a privilege. [applause and cheers] for the corporate media, for my friends in congress him of this seems like a radical idea. is it a radical idea?\nno.\nhow many major countries on earth do not guarantee health care? anyone know? one, you are living in it. i live 50 miles away from canada. in canada if you end up with cancer and in a hospital with massive treatment you know how much your bill is?\nzero.\nother countries have different systems. u.k., france, but essentially all of the major countries on earth understand if you are rich or whether you are poor, you should have the right to go in to a doctor's office when you are sick and not hesitate. [applause] we lose, we lose some 30,000 people a year because they hesitate to go to the doctor because they can't afford it or to bed -- the deductibles or copayments are too high. you will see a lot about the debate over medicare for all but what you should know is that the insurance companies and the drug companies and others in the health care industry have teamed together to do everything they can to defeat us. i can understand that. i can understand when insurance companies and drug companies make billions of dollars in profits every year when their ceo's make millions in compensation, they like the status quo. we are going to tell them clearly that when 34 million people have no health insurance and more are underinsured, when we play the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs at a time when the top 10 drug companies make $69 billion in profit last year, that is no longer acceptable to us and the american people. [applause and cheers] so we have an agenda some may think is radical. i don't. it speaks to the needs of working families and not just the 1%. and we have as part of a rigged economy, we have a corrupt political system. i want all of you to be thinking about that. you will see a lot of ads on television, some of it will come from the insurance companies and drug companies, some of it will come from the republican party, but understand that many of those will be paid for by the wealthiest people in this country because we have a political system made worse by the citizens united supreme court decision that allows billionaires to put in as much money as they want to allows -- elect candidates to represent the wealthy and powerful. our job in politics, in economics it is to create an economy that works for all of us. in politics it is to create a political system based on one person, one vote, not billionaires buying elections. [applause and cheers] one of the things about our corrupt political system that really, really bothers me is someone -- as someone who has run for office many times in vermont, sometimes i have lost, more times i have won, but it never occurs to me, how do i keep those people from voting? when you are seeing all over this country is massive efforts on the part of cowardly republican governors to suppress the vote. think big. if somebody is such a coward that they can't participate in a free and fair election, my view is they should get the hell out of politics and get another job. [applause and cheers] democratic politics, politics up a democracy, you will hear from different candidates, people in the democratic party, many of them good, you will hear from republicans, listen to what they have to say and you make the decisions how you want to vote, but it is grotesque and disgusting that we have republican governors and attorneys general all over this country who are making it harder for poor people, people of color and for young people to vote. that is not one american democracy is supposed to be about. what we are going to do in the white house is make a very simple position. that is if you are 18 years of age and you are a citizen of this country, you are entitled to vote, and of -- end of discussion. [applause and cheers] and when we talk about human rights, we have to talk about environmental rights as well. [applause] as i am sure you are all aware, donald trump and i have a few differences of opinion.\nbut maybe the most profound difference is that trump has maintained the myth climate change is a hoax and in fact is working overtime to make sure that we have more carbon emissions. trump also made the profound remark, you may remember a month or so ago that wind turbines cause cancer. did you hear that one? profound scientists, someone who has researched the issue for years and came up with that conclusion. my views are a little bit different. let's think big, not small. when we think big what we understand is at the end of the day, what is more important than the preservation of planet earth ? kind of significant, don't you think? [applause] and you all know what is going on. you have seen the increase in drought and letting and the weather disturbances, acidification of the ocean. here is what scientists tell us. many of you unfamiliar with this great we have 12 years, no time at all to transform our energy system or else we are going to see it reparable damage to this planet. i want you to think about that. one of those things about life is you can't be about yourself. you got to be thinking about other people and not only other people around you here. think about the kids and their kids, future generations. the native american people thought to think seven generations forward. we have 12 years of forward. we have amoral responsibility -- a moral response ability to leave this planet healthy and habitable for future generations. it means we have to have the courage to take on the fossil fuel industry. [applause and cheers] who insanely believe short-term profits are more important than the future of the planet. and in iowa you are doing a good job, 35% of electricity coming from wind, that is good. you are one of the leaders in the country but it is not hard. we know it has to be done and it is to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy is like wind, solar and other technologies. there are a couple of other issues that are out there. what is going on with our criminal justice system? it is profoundly broken. i want you all to be asking yourself how does it happen that in america we have more people in jail than any other country on earth? china, four times our size, we have more than this humid -- this communist country. we need real reform. [applause and cheers] and that means a number of things. that means investing in young people so that they have the education and the jobs they need rather than investing in more jails andthat incarceration. [applause and cheers] and you know what else it means, that we made some success, some progress on this in the last four years. and i was in iowa, i said we got to end this war on drugs and legalize marijuana. [applause and cheers] once again, once again they said it is too radical and idea, can't happen. state after state is doing for cicely that. you know why? over a long period of time, there were people arrested for possession of marijuana. occasionally there gone to jail but mostly what happened is they have a criminal record. what happens and you get right -- when you try to get a job? the employer says we got someone else in mind. so we have got to end the so-called war on drugs. we have got to end private prisons and detention centers. [applause and cheers] we have got to end cash bail. you know what that is? i didn't know this until a few years ago. as we speak there are hundreds of thousands of people in jail at this moment. you know why they are in jail, they are poor. they can't afford bail. that make sense? i don't think so. and we have to deal with another issue which trump has demonized, and that is the issue of immigration. we have 10 million undocumented people in this country. what trump is trying to do is demonize them which is what demagogues always do, pick on a minority and demonize. my view is we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship. [applause and cheers] that we need legal status for the 1.8 million young people eligible through the daca program. [applause and cheers] and that we need to treat people, in some cases where walked 1000 miles with babies, when they get to the border, we treat them with respect and dignity and do not snatch babies out of the arms of their mothers. [applause and cheers] having said all of that i want to get to what that sign means. the people's hands must be -- arms must be tired did -- holding it up. why is that an important thing?\nall together.\nyeah, but --\nthis is what i suspect no other candidate will tell you appeared i will say this about the candidates. many of them are in the senate and they are friends of mine. you have good people. i want you to hear what they have to say. i will tell you this, at the end of the day, needless to say i hope i win, they hope they win, but at the end of the day you are going to see all of the candidates coming together around the winner to make sure donald trump is defeated. [applause and cheers] but let me tell you, let me tell you what that sign -- those signs mean. it means the matter who is elected president, not the most honest, smartest, best intentioned person -- [laughter] the truth is that that person cannot do it alone. i will tell you why. this is something you don't see on tv much. that is the power structure of america is such that you have insurance companies, drug companies, wall street owning assets equivalent, six street banks owning assets equivalent to 54% of the gdp [indiscernible] six. you have fossil fuel companies making billions and lying about climate change could you have the military-industrial complex getting huge cost overruns and making incredible amounts of money at a time when we spent more than the next 10 nations combined on the military. here is the point. in order to -- what i want to do , to win the democratic nomination with your help, all right? [applause and cheers] i want to defeat donald trump him of it goes without saying. [applause and cheers] but i want to do something else, and i wouldn't be running for president if it wasn't what i want to do. i want to work with you to transform this country and our national priorities. but one person cannot do it alone. i want you all to think about american history. think about 150 years ago when workers were forced to work 15, 18 hours a day, when they could be fired arbitrarily, children working in factories and in the fields. and working people stood up and said we will not accept that anymore. we as workers want to be treated with respect and dignity. we will form unions and engage in collective bargaining because we can't do it alone. we need to come together and sit with our employer and negotiate a decent contract and decent wages. that is what the history of the trade union movement has been. think about the history of the civil rights movement. do you think it was just dr. martin luther king jr., one of the great american leaders? it wasn't him alone. he would tell you. it was millions of people coming together to save -- say we will no longer accept racism and discrimination in the united states of america. [applause and cheers] and when the american people stood up, black and white and latino stood up and said this is insane, to tell people because of the color of their skin they can't cast a ballot in alabama or mississippi, we are going to end that. they did. think about the women's movement. a little over 100 years ago women in america didn't have the right to vote. they were treated unfairly. women could do the jobs -- not do the jobs their hearts wanted to do. they couldn't get the education they wanted. that changed not by anything in washington. it said women will no longer be second-class citizens in the united states of america. [applause and cheers] and on that issue, god knows we still have a long way to go. we are seeing state after state including your state working very hard to try to deny a woman the right to control her own body. we are going to change that. same story with the gay community. i am old enough to member when people were deadly afraid to tell their friends or their parents that they were gay. people were beaten, 2 million, until finally -- humiliated until finally enough people said you have a right to love anybody regardless of their gender theory that of his results -- gender. that is a result of people standing up. so what not me, us means, not just a slogan, it is an understanding that no president can do it alone because you have got the power of wall street and the corporate media, insurance companies, drug companies, fossil fuel industries, the whole 1%. no president alone can do it. the way change happens is when millions of people stand up and look around and say, there is something wrong when three families own more wealth than the bottom half of our people. something wrong with the top 1% -- something wrong with 49% of all new income today goes to the top 1%. when people say, that ain't right, that ain't right, people begin to stand up and get involved in the process, that is the way change has always taken place, and that is the way change will take place today. in iowa, you have a very, you are in a special position. people take the first in the country caucus very seriously and go to hear all kinds of things. they think part of what they want to support. i respect that in our mostly. -- enormously. in iowa you have enormous importance. -- i always do that. never fails. last time i came to iowa, we were 3% in the polls. on -- [applause and cheers] so i am very grateful, very hateful to the people of iowa, but you have an enormous responsibility. so i hope very much given the special role iowa plays that you will get heavily involved in the political process. i hope you will participate in our campaign, which is trying to wage a political revolution in this country, not just win an election but wage a political revolution. you can do it. we need people -- the media made a big deal we raised a lot of money area that is good. we have over one million people in this country prepared to volunteer in this country. with your help, with your use of social media, knocking on doors, talking to your friends, and don't let your friends tell you politics is all bullshit and they don't have the time to get involved. you don't want to hear them moaning and groaning about student debt or $10 an hour wage, or can't afford housing, tell them to stop moaning and groaning, and get involved in the political process and transform this economy. with your help that is what we can do. thank you all very much.

[cheers & applause]\nhi, everybody! [cheers & applause] [laughs]\nhardly seems possible, or years ago, we were doing something similar to this. it is even more exciting today. it really is. times, they are a-changin', but they are changing for the best. and we need a guy. we need a guy who works hard. i worked for barney 18 years in his office -- bernie 18 years in his office, then press conferences before then. i could not keep up with him. someone asked -- how can he do all of that? i said, i don't know, i think he is the energizer rabbit. he has always been ahead of his time, but i think his time is now. eight of 18 charges [cheers & applause]\nyou may remember i am a dairy farmer, and i would tell you, there would be more farmers here today if we did not have this one good day of the week. [laughter]\nit does not matter is it is a holiday weekend, those fields have got to get planted, because we have got to get milk. we have lost almost one-third of our farms here in vermont just since 2010. but this one guy who stands out from the crowd and is willing to go out on the farm and let you teach him how to milk, it is bernie. and you know, he did not come for any photo op, he got in there with the first cow was melt, and he stayed in there, i think it was 130 cows milk. he was having in there with us having breakfast. and he asked my husband, bill, more darn questions than you would ever believe. he wants to know what the common person is up to. what is your thinking? why do you think he goes all of those town meetings? we've had town meetings in our grange, our farmer house, on the llawn, he wants to know, and that is why he is so impressive, because he knows us, the common people. you know, there was a guy waved back, his name was william jennings bryan, it he ran for congress in nebraska. he was leaving the democratic party, setting policy for people to think about and act on. he wrote down these words. \"burn down your cities and leave our farms. your cities will spring up again as if by magic, but destroy our farms, and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country.\" and bernie is that kind of guy. he understands what it means to have a rural america plan to bring life back to the community, and, darn it all, how could he not? he lives here in vermont. we are so rural. we have our wonderful city of burlington that we can escape to sometimes, but we need our green fields and our mountains come our trees. heaven knows farmers are great for helping capture what is good in our environment. we work hard every day and keep those landscapes working and growing your food, our food. bernie knows that national food security, national security, period! -- depends on people growing their own food. the more local, the better. [cheers & applause]\nseveral years ago, we had christine varney come to saint albans. she happens to be the person in charge of the antitrust division, and we talked to her about our concern that things were getting more and more vertically integrated, that farmers were finding fewer and fewer places to sell their milk, to market their milk. she wrote a wonderful report, she went over to the country, she wrote to hog farmers, soy, and corn, an in every instance, it was the same. she wrote the report, was working for the department of justice, and disappeared, back into private life. nothing was done. bernie has got antitrust, merger, consolidation, all of those things in his rural plan, and it means a lot to me to see him push that yet once again. but he needs a congress behind him that is going to support him as president and get something done. all right, i told you all about -- not really -- but anyway, bernie is to make for vermont, i am sorry. i told him that. i said, \"you just wait, they are going to catch up to you, bernie, and then you are going to get something done.\" i think we are there. [cheers & applause]\nbernie has had folks working with him. he has learned a lot. he has been all over this country. he is ready. and we are ready for him. [cheers & applause]\nand now, let me just remind you, if i can find the right paper, that if you want to show your support for bernie, and some of you have on your green t-shirts, check this out. in that white text and in that red umbrella there over th there somewhere, you can get t-shirts, bumper stickers, and another way that you can get is right from your phone. i will give you your the number. you text the word \"donate\" and the number 67760. no amount is too small, let me tell you. if farmers can get, everybody can give. [laughs] [cheers & applause]\nso i have got a reason to vote this year. how about you? [cheers & applause]\nwe have got a guy that gives us reason to want to vote, and it is going to be more important than ever this year. don't lose faith, have hope, and eat lots of good vermont products. thank you. [cheers & applause]\nplease welcome to the stage montpelier high school student hope petraro. [cheers & applause]\nhi, everyone. thank you so much for showing up today. i am so excited to be here with you all today, not only to share my past experiences in the lovely state of vermont, but the glimmering hope and the potential that i firmly believe our future holds. i am 16 years old. i am a junior at montpelier high school, just a few blocks that way. i am a member of the vermont youth lobby, an organization of high school students from around the state to advocate for climate justice in vermont. [cheers & applause] and planned a rally for the planet on the statehouse lawn each year. i also cofounded the race against racism, an event against racism in vermont. [cheers & applause]\nso as someone who is regularly thinking about world issues, and, like many young people who are inheriting the world today, the question that is usually at the forefront of my mind is -- how can i advocate for what i believe in? how can we, as a state and as a nation, create real and exacting change and push for equality and justice in all facets of the world that we live in? i support bernie sanders, because he stands up for the reform that american people need. he is a candidate who advocates for comprehensive legislation and the necessary infrastructure to some were low income, working, and rural vermonters. [cheers & applause]\ni support many, because he is willing to act on climate change, a defining issue of our time and one is already unleashing its effects, and will help bring vermont to its goal of 90% for noble energy by 2050 -- renewable energy by 2050. [cheers & applause]\nby taking firm stances in the face of an action and by the fire and corporate interests, bernie is changing the face of american politics and truly representing the people he represents. in the fight against climate change, against big-money and complex, again xenophobia, racism, and hatred, against growing income inequality, there is an opportunity to fight for what we believe in. our next step in the state and of a nation one not just affect us, it will affect generations around the world for hundreds and hundreds of years to come, and we in vermon can and will fight for what we believe in, for equity, entrepreneurship, for community, for justice, and most of all, for progress. thank you. [cheers & applause]\nplease welcome to the stage representative peter wellsch.\nhello, montpelier. welcome to bernie country. bernie sanders for president of the united states! [cheers & applause]\ni will talk a little bit about the politics, but i want to talk about bernie sanders, my friend. you know, he won that landslide in 1981, where he had overwhelming support to become the mayor of burlington, vermont. that was the year i began serving in the senate, so we were in politics together. every step of the way along my career, when i served in the state senate, bernie was my friend and was always there, politically but also personally. when i ran for governor in 1990 and lost, bernie was there. he helped me, he stayed close to me. when i was out of politics and he was in, as our unit u.s. representative in the house of representatives, when we and my family have some downtimes, sad times, bernie was there. and then when i served in his shoes -- and i do not want to say that i filled his shoes, but i serve in his job, as i do now, every single day, if there's anything i need to help me succeed and help vermonters and i need bernie's help, bernie is there. and we spent a lot of time just accidentally, on the plane, talking about how smoothly things are going in washington. [laughter]\nand so far when it is time for one of us to give the other a ride home or pick up the cab fare, some say bernie is tight, but so far i am ahead of them by at least 5-1. thank you, bernie! but i tell you this because friendship matters. we have our political issues, and we have had a wonderful discussion about it, but friendship matters. loyalty to your friends matters. remembering where you come from matters. we do not have somebody in the white house who can or member who his friend was let alone his wife was the other day. [cheers & applause]\nfriendship matters! and you know, we are also, we are proud of bernie. we love vermonters, and we share something that is dear to us. our constitution, the state of vermont, was the 1st constitution in the united states of america to expand prohibited condemn slavery. [cheers & applause]\nand then in the civil war, it was young men in the hard rock fields of vermont who came down those fields more than any other state on a per capita basis contributed to the union cards and ended legal slavery in this country. that was vermonters that did that! and when we were continuing to face the challenge of discrimination, and vermonters to the position that we know vermonters will only take, that everybody should be able to love the person they love -- [cheers & applause]\nit was in that statehouse that our legislature, with republicans and democrats, made that a legal right. [cheers & applause]\nand i have got to tell you, if anybody embodies that tradition of expanding opportunity, inequality to all people, it is bernie sanders who has done it from day one. [cheers & applause]\nnow, let me talk a little bit about the politics. you know, i have heard sometimes people criticize bernie because he is giving the same message. think about it. he was always for a higher minimum wage. is there something wrong with that? he was always for equality and diversity. any problem with that?\nno!\nhe was always for health care for all. have you got a problem with that?\nnoi!!\nhe was always for affordable, accessible, and free hiring a education. anybody got a problem with that? and he opposed the war, that terrible bush legislation, and he's a ordered the men and women -- he supported the women who came home. people who have a problem with that are now running against him, because they said it was too much in 26 income of it is doctrine in 2020. thank you, bernie sanders! [cheers & applause]\nyou know, we have got a president -- you read the mueller report, obstruction of justice, 10 separate incidents, then you have an attorney general who says the president is above the law, and there is no accountability, and that we have a president who, when he is having a meeting with cy pelosi and chuck schumer about a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, he said before, he walked out on them into minutes! and you know what, with all of the division that we have in this country, when we were at the height of the civil war, abraham lincoln and the congress of the united states built the transcontinental railroad. bernie sanders is a doer, he is a healer, he is a uniter, and, yes, he has been consistent. and you know what? he has been consistent in his friendships. he has been consistent in his advocacy for vermont. and he has been consistent in his advocacy for the opportunity for all americans, and it is about time we get a president of the united states who knows where he comes from anhui is for -- from and who he is for, and that is bernie sanders! [cheers & applause]\nchanting] bernie, bernie, bernie, bernie.\nplease welcome to the stage national cochair of the bernie sanders campaign, ben cohen!\nhello, everybody! what a beautiful day for ice cream in montpelier! [cheers & applause]\nyou know, before bernie, jerry and i used to be the most famous guys from vermont, so now we are happy and proud to pass that distinction on to bernie. i mean, ice cream is good, but a president of the united states who truly believes in justice in all its flavors? that is euphoric! [cheers & applause]\nyou know, the trajectories of ben & jerry's and bernie are pretty interconnected, so i would just like to talk a little bit about the old days, and then bring us up-to-date. in 1978, when ben & jerry's for started, i was living in burlington under the rule of the long-term democratic machine mayor morty paquette and his old cronies on the city council. i remember going to the city council for permission to show free outdoor movies in front of our ice cream shop and being told no, never, not in this city, and i remember as a struggling ice cream man in that old gas station feeling overcome with joy at the victory party in the basement of the memorial auditorium when bernie was elected mayor. free outdoor movies in burlington continue to this day! but during those early days of bernie's administration, the old guard controlled the city council, and they thwarted anything and everything bernie tried to do, so bernie did some basic, common sense stuff that the good old boys just could not argue with. bernie's staff conducted the first audit of burlington's pension system in a quarter century. they move the city's money into higher-yielding accounts. they raised fees for building permits and for utilities that dug up the city streets. they ended the city's old crony insurance contract and open them up to competitive bids. altogether, bernie saved the city of burlington hundreds of thousands of dollars. the old guard could not stop him, in the next election, they were voted out of office. then bernie was faced with a plan left over from mayor gordy to privatize lake champlain with expensive condominiums. bernie father that plan in court, and instead of high-end condos on the shoreline, he created a public park, a community boat house, a marina, a bypass, and some commercial and residential as well. the wonderful thing about bernie is that he created a city government that put the needs of people first and the needs of business second, and that is exactly the way it should be. there is no reason why business cannot prosper without erasing and destroying the very society that supports it. [cheers & applause]\nbernie calls it democratic socialism. i call it social capitalism. and bernie built a city government that endured. he created cedo, the community economic development office. is fallen and supported not only ben & jerry's but other companies that are now national, like burton snowboards, seventh generation, magic cap, and lake champlain chocolates. they all began during bernie's time as mayor, and cedo exists to this day, targeting assistance and loans to small businesses, micro enterprises, and employers to provide livable wage jobs. it was during bernie's administration that plans were conceived to create a supermarket for burlington. today, the city market is one of the highest volume supermarkets per square foot in the country. and it was bernie who helped will rat take garbage land and turn it into productive farms that now supply over 10% of burlington's food. the way bernie ran the city of burlington was just good business. but bernie has always been about more than doing the right thing at home, he has always understood that we are all interconnected, that if you care about evil, it does not matter what country they were born in. -- care about people, it does not matter what country they were born in. he is not a politician who sticks his finger in the wind and says what he thinks voters want him to say. he is a man who sticks to his principals and does what he truly believes. [cheers & applause]\nhe has always been antiwar. he has always been for solutions based on peace and justice. of all the candidates running for candidate, it is bernie sanders who have been most consistently opposed to killing people in other lands in our name and with our money. [cheers & applause]\nhe has steadfastly resisted u.s. intervention in the internal affairs of other countries. he voted against every bloated defense budget since he got to washington. he voted against going to war in iraq. he opposes u.s. intervention in venezuela and iran. [cheers & applause]\nand it was bernie who brought republicans and democrats together to pass a resolution to prevent the u.s. from participating in the saudi-led war in yemen. [cheers & applause]\nwe have seen him in action know that bernie lives and breathes peace, justice, and common sense. he has dedicated his life to it, and he has done it successfully in the face of opposition from entrenched interests. it is not often. this is the first time -- well, no, it is the second time in my life that we have the opportunity to elect a president that truly represents our values, a man who has proven himself, has withstood the rigors, spears, and arrows of 40 years in public office and has never wavered. he is tried and true. we in vermont no bernie and can about for him like nobody else can. we have this opportunity, but only if we work to make it happen. so how do we do it? well, the first thing that we can do, right here, right now, today, is, on your way out, you pull over to that blue tent over there, it is a beautiful blue tent, all the way over there, and what they have got theirre is some bernie bumper stickers. you take one, and you stick it on your car. if you have got to cars, you take to. if you have got some friends that want to stick it on their cars, you take some to them, too. and if anybody in that tent says you cannot take that many, you tell them that i said so, because in bernie's campaign, i am the king of bumper stickers. [laughter] [cheers & applause]\nand the reason that i am the king of blubber stickers is that i believe in bumper stickers just about as much as i believe in bernie. when you put a bumper sticker on your car, it means something. it is worth more than buying tv ads, because it is your personal endorsement, and that cannot be bought. there might not be that many of us in vermont, but two-thirds of us voted for bernie, and there are a lot of tourists who will be coming through here this summer. if every other car those tourists see has a bernie bumper sticker on it, that is going to be big, that is going to be a lot, and that is going to send a message that the people of vermont know this guy, and they support him, and they are out front with their support. don't forget, the blue tent, as many bumper stickers as you want, i say. finally, we have got a presidential candidate worth working for. let's pull out all the stops. let's elect bernie sanders president of the united states of america. [cheers & applause]\nplease welcome to the stage journalist and activist don king.\nvermont, how are you? [cheers & applause]\ni am glad to be here with you today. early this morning, in the middle of brooklyn, new york, my wife and our kids loaded up our car and drove six hours from brooklyn to burlington. [cheers & applause]\nand then here to the capital to be here with you this weekend, because we love bernie sanders! [cheers & applause]\nand i am so honored to be able to introduce bernie to you today. first, because bernie sanders is a hero to me, and he is a hero to you. bernie is the living embodiment of what it means to actually live out your values, to walk your talk. i tell people that right now, we could go to any website for anybody running for president, and all of those websites are amazing. they will all inspired you, because now that they are running for president, the candidates believe in every good and perfect idea imaginable. but bernie's website is not just a brochure for who he hopes to be someday. he is not just telling us what he would do if he were to become president. every idea that is on bernie's website emanates from the life that he actually lives right now. [cheers & applause]\nlisten, every principle and policy on bernie's website is rooted in what he has been fighting for his entire life. for me, and i hope for you, the greatest indication of what you will actually do as president is not what you put on your website , it is not what you promised on the campaign trail, the greatest indication of who you will fight for and what you ll fwiht for as predentsi is to end what you have been fighting for your entire life. [cheers & applau]se\nthat is why we love bernie, because we see who and what he has been fighting for all of these fears. and listen, not a single political leader in this country have more consistently fought for everyday people and their rights and their dignity and their safety and their future like bernie sanders, and nobody knows that better than vermont. [cheers & applause]\nlisten, bernie is what it looks like for a young civil rights activist and organizer to grow up in one day join the government, but never actually lose his sensibilities and spirit as a fighter against the status quo. i have said it before, but bernie has been giving the man hell for over 70 years, right? [cheers & applause]\nbernie is a trendsetter. this week, i hope you saw it, when bernie stood up for mcdonald's workers this week, working side-by-side with them. they invited bernie to stand with them, and when he did it, half of the other people running for president followed suit, because bernie says that trends -- sets the trends. [cheers & applause]\nfor months, bernie has been standing with the drivers of uber and lyft as their founders and executives reap billions and billions of dollars, but their drivers are not even making minimum wage. bernie is standing with those drivers. bernie consistently has been standing with the workers of walmart as they work day in and day out, owned by a company with owners, a family that is literally the richest family and our country, but most of them literally cannot pay their bills, and bernie stands by them. listen, bernie sanders is a bulldog for what he believes in. [cheers & applause]\nhe is a bulldog for workers, for workers rights. he is a bulldog for fair pay, for equal pay, and for wages that people can actually live off of. bernie right now is a bulldog for the environment, clean water, clean air, for the preservation of public land. [cheers & applause]\nhe is a bulldog for civil rights and human rights, not just in the united states, but all over the world, and he has been speaking out against war for over 50 years. i was proud to hear ben say it, because bernie spoke out against vietnam, he voted against the disastrous war in iraq, and he is speaking out today against the gross actions going on right now in yemen, and bernie is speaking out against a foolish war that trump wants to start with iran. listen, we need an antiwar president, and bernie has been fighting for peace is entire life! [cheers & applause]\nand it is great for me to be able to brag about bernie to some people that actually get him, that understand him, and really understand what he means to this state and what he has done right here in vermont as a leader, and why he is literally the single most popular senator in america, because you know his character, and you know his record. listen, no single senator in the nation has consistently had approval ratings as high as bernie sanders with the voters of vermont. [cheers & applause]\nyear after year, including this year, he is the single most popular senator in the nation, and not only is burning the longest-serving independent in the entire history of the united states, but for 21 straight years, he has never received less than 63% of the vote in vermont, because you have bernie's back. [cheers & applause]\nand this story really has not been told nationally, and it is going to take you telling it and letting people know, because every single year that bernie was mayor of burlington,'s approval ratings went up every single year. every single time he was reelected, all four times, he was elected by a larger margin than he was the previous term. now, the first time he was elected, it was not hard to win by a larger margin, because he just won by 10 votes, but the margin grew by thousands of votes every year after that. and for just a moment, as i close, i want to brag not just to all of you here but to the whole world about bernie's life of leadership in vermont, because so much of what bernie has fought for here in vermont was really rooted in his love of dr. martin luther king and what dr. king was fighting for at the end of his life. listen, do the research and find out and see for yourself, that the end of his life, dr. king was fighting for workers' rights, he was fighting for fair pay, he was fighting for affordable housing, and he was fighting to end senseless wars. and when bernie moves to vermont, he tried his best to pick up that mantle and run with it, and you supported him every step of the way. [cheers & applause]\nlisten, we need you to make sure these stories are told everywhere, because i regularly hear people ask -- what has bernie actually done? and bernie has done so much across the years, but he is too humble to brag about it and tell the story himself, so we have to tell these stories for him. listen, there are two beautiful stories that i want to leave you with. in 1984, when bernie was the mayor of burlington, he started funding something called the burlington community land trust, and he started doing it just $200,000 at a time. and the idea was that the city would partner with families in creative ways so that they could have affordable housing, and today, that trust, that really started being funded when bernie was mayor, has a portfolio of 3000 affordable homes worth over $300 million. bernie sanders got that started. it is literally the single largest home ownership trust in the entire nation, and the families who live in those homes are 10 times less likely to ever default on their mortgages, and these are the types of creative ideas that we would see from president bernie sanders. [cheers & applause]\nwhen bernie was mayor, he wrote laws mandating that new apartments that were built had to allot at least 25% of their units for affordable housing, and he made sure that those people who built those units guaranteed they were affordable for 99 years! mayor bernie sanders did that. now, that is more than any other city in the nation. and when bernie started doing that as many mayor, it was a novel ide, but now almost every big city in the country is now doing what bernie was doing in the mid-1980's. [cheers & applause]\nin 1986, when 336 residents of the northgate apartments in burlington risked being evicted or displaced when the owner was going to double their rent, bernie literally said,, and this is a quote, \"over my dead body will these residents be displaced.\" [cheers & applause]\nand, you know, we laugh when the president called them \"crazy bernie,\" because sometimes he is a little crazy, but crazy in a good way, because in 1986, a really helped lead an insurrection with the residents of that apartment complex, and he raised the money for the city to buy that apartment complex, and he started something so that over the course of 20 years, the 336 residents of the north gate apartments would actually own the entire apartment complex. and right now, it is one of the only resident-owned, controlled, and managed apartment complexes in the entire country, and bernie sanders helped make that happen. [cheers & applause]\nwhen people ask you what has bernie dein, remind them that when he was mayor of burlington, it has the lowest unemployment rate of any city in america, remind them that right now in vermont, this state has below is unemployment rate of any state in the nation. in bernie sanders has helped create the climate and the culture that is attractive to businesses that have provided many of you with the jobs that you have today. right now, vermont has the sixth highest life expectancy rate. almost every year for the last 10 years, vermont has been rated the first or second safest state in the nation. vermont spends the second most money per pupil of any state and have the best teacher- student ratio in the nation. and here is the thing -- bernie knows what i know, and it is why we need to elect him as president. bernie knows that when a state has affordable housing, when a state has good jobs, when a state has low unemployment, when children have good schools, when the air is clean and the water is clean, guess what else goes down? crime goes down. despair goes down. hopelessness goes down. and 30 years ago, bernie said these words, and i am so touched by it, because we are living really in his prediction. bernie said, quote, \"maybe, just maybe, in vermont, we will strike a little bit of a spark that might spread across the country.\" [cheers & applause]\nlisten, vermont, you made him your mayor, you made him your congressman, you have made him your senator, but, vermont, i believe it is time that you take the spark that was started here, i believe it is time that you take that spark and help make bernie sanders the next president of the united states. together, we can make that happen. ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our brother, our hero, and the future president of the united states, senator bernie sanders! [cheers & applause] (music) [cheers & applause]\nwhoa! [cheers & applause]\nthank you, montpelier! let me begin by thanking blank kennedy -- blayne kennedy fitzgerald, the young lady from coal chester, what a beautiful world. let me thank grammy award winner brandi carlile. let me thank jenny nelson, who has one of the most beautiful farms in the state. let me thank hope petraro, the part of the young generation that is going to help transform this country. let me thank congressman peter welch. peter and i have worked for so many years, thank you for yr work, peter. and let me thank longtime friend ben cohen. you know, in 1928, herbert hoover ran for president on a message that said \"a chicken in every pot.\" will maybe we run in 2020 on a message that says \"cherry garcia in every freezer!\" [cheers & applause]\nthank you, ben, for all that you have done for this state and country. and let me thank shaun king and his family. [cheers & applause]\ni think many of you do not know that shaun is one of the real leaders in addressing a major, major crisis in this country, andhat t is the need to reform a racist and bren criminal justice system. [cheers & applause]\ntoday, i want to thank all of you for being here this afternoon. it looks like we are getting a little sun. and let me mostly thank the people of the state of vermont, who have given me an opportunity that, when i was a kid, i never would have dreamed of in a million years, and that is to be the mayor of burlington, to be a united states congressman from vermont, and now you're united states senator. it has been the honor of my life, and i thank you all. [cheers & applause]\nand here standing in front of our beautiful state house, we can reflect a bit upon the history of our small but proud state. we were the first state in the country to outlaw slavery. [cheers & applause]\nand vermont was a major part of the underground railroad. we were the first state in the country to mandate public funding for universal education. [cheers\nmore recently, we were the first state whose legislature voted to legalize same-sex marriage. [cheers & applause]\nwe are proud that vermont is a state which, over the years, has held its head high in the struggle for human freedom and justice in is a state that i know will continue to do so. [cheers & applause]\nin recent years, working together, we have accomplished much for our state. starting and burlington in the 1980's, as shaun just mentioned, we were the first municipality in the country to fund a community land trust that not only gave working people the ability to own their own homes but to make sure that those homes would be perpetually affordable. and that idea has spread not only all over this country, but in fact all over the world. [cheers & applause]\nand as the nation tackles the crisis in health care, we are proud that vermont is helping to lead the nation in expanding qualified community health centers. in vermont, we have expanded and improved veterans' health care at the v.a. in white river junction. and in towns throughout the state. as the former chairman of the u.s. senate committee on veterans affairs, i have always believed that the men and women who put their life on the line, who defend our country, deserve the best quality health care this nation can provide. [cheers & applause]\nin vermont, we have been a national leader in energy efficiency and the movement to sustainable energy. unlike some, we know that climate change is real. [cheers & applause]\nin vermont, especially relevant in this particular moment in american history, given what is happening in alabama, in georgia, and all over the country. in vermont, we understand that women have a constitutional right to control their own bodies! [cheers & applause] it is not the u.s. congress, or the state government, or the local government that will control a woman's body, it is the women of this country themselves! [cheers & applause]\nand now as we assemble today, here in front of our beautiful state capital, in this pivotal and unprecedented moment in american history, i am here today to ask for your support to help me win the democratic nomination. [cheers & applause]\nchanting] bernie, bernie, bernie, bernie, bernie, bernie, bernie, bernie, bernie!\ni am asking for your support to help me defeat donald trump, the most dangerous president in the history of this country! [cheers & applause]\nand today, i am asking your help to help me lead this country in transforming this nation, so that together, we create an economy and a government that works for all of us and not just the privileged few! [cheers & applause]\nand today, i want to welcome you to a campaign which says with confidence, optimism, and love that the underlying principles of our government will not be greed, hatred, and lies. [cheers & applause]\nthe underlying principle of our government will not be racism, will not be sexism, will not be xenophobia, and will not be religious bigotry. [cheers & applause]\nand all of the other mean-spirited, un-american beliefs of the trump administration. the principles of our government will be based on justice, economic justice, racial justice, social justice, and environmental justice. [cheers & applause]\nour campaign and our government is about bringing our people together, not dividing them. [cheers & applause]\ntoday, i am not going to spend a lot of time talking about donald trump, one of my least favorite subjects, because you already know more about him than\nyou know that, sadly, we have a president who is a pathological liar, and that he says whatever he wants, without regard to the truth. you know that we have a president who has no understanding or respect for the constitution of the united states and the separation of powers and is attempting to move every single day this country into an authoritarian form of government.\nbooing]\nthing for a moment -- who would have ever believed that we could have a president of the united states who considers the media in this country as an enemy of the people?\nbooing]\nwho lavishes praise on the spot and anti-democratic leaders all over the world, who storms out of meetings after parading and insulting -- berating and insulting congressional leaders and who refuses to obey congressional subpoenas.\nbooing]\nbut that is not all. during his campaign for the presidency, donald trump told the american people that he was going to defend the interests of the working class of this country. he lied. instead of protecting the interests of working people, he attempted to throw 32 million americans off of the health care they currently have.\nbooing]\nhe attempted to do away with the protections that all americans have for pre-existing health conditions. that is not defending the interests of the working class, that is the training the working class of this country -- that is betraying the working class of this country. during his campaign for president, trump promised not to touch medicare, medicaid, and social security. he lied. his budget calls for a $1.5 trillion cut to medicaid over 10 $845 billion from medicare and millions more in cuts to social security.\nboos]\nbut some of you may remember, when trump ran for president, he said, you know what, we are going to have a tax plan that will not benefit wealthy people. remember that? he lied, again. 83% of his benefits in that tax plan go to the top 1% at the end of 10 years.\nboos]\nduring his campaign for president, trump said he would \"drain the swamp.\" he lied. that swamp is murkier now than it has ever been, and his administration is the most corrupt in the modern history of the country.\nboos]\nfurther, and dangerously, trump is endangering the future of our country and the entire planet by refusing to acknowledge the reality of climate change, and is in fact making a horrific situation even worse by encouraging the production of more fossil fuels.\nboos]\nhard to believe. the scientists tell us we have only 12 years, not a very long time, before we see irreparable, irreparable harm done to this planet, and we have a president who ignores that stunning reality. but our campaign is not about donald trump. it is about something far more important. it is about laying out a new vision for our country, a vision that speaks to the needs of ordinary americans, people from coast to coast who for too long have been ignored. [cheers & applause]\nit is a vision which is going to bring our people together. black and white and latino, native american, asian-american, men or women, young or old, gay or straight, native-born or immigrant. [cheers & applause]\nours is a vision which calls upon our best instincts, not our worst. it is a vision that understands that love conquers hate, and that when we stand together in common purpose, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish. [cheers & applause]\nours is a vision which states unequivocally that in the united states of america, we believe in democracy, not authoritarianism! [cheers & applause]\nit is hard for me to believe that in the united states of america, in the year 2019, we have to say that. but unfortunately, we do. too many brave men and women have fought and died to defend democracy in our country, and we will not allow donald trump or anyone else to take it away! [cheers & applause]\nwe wanty our country to have the highest voter turnout in the industrialized world, not one of the lowest. we believe we must make it easier for people to vote, not harder. [cheers & applause]\nwhich is why we are going to take on those cowardly republican governors from coast to coast who are trying to suppress the vote. [cheers & applause]\nthey are trying to make it harder for people of color, for poor people, for young people to vote. when we become the government of the united states, the law will be that if you are a citizen of this country and you are 18 years of age, you have the right to vote, end of discussion! [cheers & applause]\nand when we talk about democracy, i believe that elections should be decided by one person, one vote, not billionaires buying elections! [cheers & applause]\nand that is why, when you all come to my inauguration -- [cheers & applause] [chanting \"bernie\"]\nwe need a lot of buses to get to washington. you already to -- you all ready to come? [cheers & applause]\nand when we are in the white house, we will begin the process to overthrow that disastrous citizens united supreme court decision. [cheers & applause]\nand we are going to move toward public funding of elections! when our job is not just to reform a corrupt political system, it is to create an economy based on justice, not uncontrollable and destructive greed! [cheers & applause]\nthis is the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, but most people don't know that because almost all of the wealth and new income is going to a small number of people at the top of the economic ladder. [crowd boos]\nso that me be as clear as i can be. we need a government that reins in the uncontrollable greed of the billionaire class and the power of the special interests. [cheers & applause]\nwe don't need an economy that just makes the rich much richer. we don't need an economy in which half of our people are living paycheck-to-paycheck, wondering how they will feed their families, pay the light bill, or put gas in the car. all the while, three families in america own more wealth than the bottom half of the american people. [crowd boos]\nwe don't need an economy in which billions of workers in vermont and around this country are forced to work two or three jobs to put food on the table. an economy where 500,000 people will be sleeping out on the streets tonight, while 49% of all new income is going to the top 1%. [crowd boos]\nwe need an economy that allows all americans to have a decent standard of living and to live productive, secure lives. [cheers & applause]\nwe don't need an economy in which so few have so much, and so many have so little. and today, we think about those moms and dads in vermont, in california, who cannot afford quality childcare. and today, we think about public school teachers who are taking money out of their own pockets to buy supplies for their kids in underfunded schools. [cheers & applause]\nand today, we think about veterans who are sleeping out on the streets. we are going to create an economy that works for the elderly, the children, our veterans, the sick and the poor, not just the 1%. [cheers & applause]\nand if you will allow me, i want to take a few minutes just to give you a couple of examples of what is going on in this country when i talk about greed and how we are going to change that when we get into the white house. example one. in america today, we have one family, the walton family of walmart. this is a family that is worth $175 billion. they are doing well. meanwhile, this very same family that owns walmart pays its work ers wages that are so low, many of those employees are forced to go on government programs, like medicaid, food stamps and public housing. in other words, working families, you here in vermont and throughout this country, are paying extra taxes to subsidize the wealthiest family in this country! [crowd boos]\nhow insane is that? next week, just next week, as the result of an invitation i received from walmart workers, i will be going to arkansas to participate in the walmart stockholders' meeting. [cheers & applause]\nnow, i think the workers very much for -- thank the workers very much for allowing me to represent them at that meeting. i'm not quite so sure how welcoming the walton family will be. but let me tell you what i will tell them. and my message to the walton family will be, pay your workers a living wage! 15 bucks an hour! [cheers & applause]\nwe do not want to continue providing corporate welfare for the richest family in america. [cheers & applause]\nand the message to the fast food industry is exactly the same. on thursday just a couple days ago, i teleconference into a rally in texas held by mcdonald's workers, and i was proud to join with them in their fight for $15 an hour, and the right for workers in the fast food industry to join a union. [cheers & applause]\nnow, this is not a complicated issue. in the richest country in the world, if you work 40 hours a week, you should not be living in poverty. and that is why together we will raise the national minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour! [cheers & applause]\nand by the way, when we talk about wages, we believe in equal pay for equal work! [cheers & applause]\nso that's the walton family. let me give you another story. and this is something i have been working on for a while. as you may know, jeff bezos, anyone know who jeff bezos is? [crowd boos]\nmr. bezos is the owner of amazon, and the wealthiest person in america, worth about $114 billion. and for years, my office in washington has been hearing from amazon workers all over the country about the starvation wages they were receiving, and about the unhealthy working conditions that they were forced to abide. i am very proud that, working with those employees, we were able to get amazon to raise their minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. [cheers & applause]\nand working with the unions in california, we raised the minimum wage at disneyland also to 15 bucks an hour. [cheers & applause]\nbut the amazon story about greed is not yet over. last year, after making $11 billion in profits, amazon paid zero in federal income taxes. [crowd boos]\nthat is what a rigged economy is about. you subsidize the wealthiest family in america, because they don't pay their workers a living wage. and the wealthiest guy in america, at the company that makes $11 billion, does not pay a nickel in taxes. [crowd boos]\nand that is what we are taking on in this campaign, and what we are going to take on in the white house. [cheers & applause]\nbut it is not just the low wages that wal-mart pays, or the ability of amazon not to pay any federal income taxes. it goes a lot deeper than that. let me tell you something that i think that no candidate for president perhaps has ever talked about. that is the power structure of america. who owns america. who has the economic and political power to demand that congress work for them, and not just ordinary people. so it is not just amazona and it is not just walmart. it is about wall street. where six ficial institutions have assets equivalent to 50% of the gdp of our country, and c ontrol the flow of trillions of dollars. well, you know what? today we tell wall street, we're going to break up the major ficial institutions in this country. [cheers & applause] if a bank is too big to fail, a bank is too big to exist! [cheers & applause]\nbut it is not just wall street, oir walmart, or amazon that are ripping off the american people. take a hard look at the unbelievable greed and power of the pharmaceutical industry! [crowd boos]\nlisten to this. last year, the top 10 drug companies in america made $69 billion in profit. meanwhile, they charged you, and you, and everyone else in america the highest prices in the world, by far, for the medicine that they need. [crowd boos]\ninsanely, and it is insane, one out of five americans cannot afford to fill the prescriptions that their doctors prescribe. well, i've got bad news for the drug companies. we're going to cut the cost of prescription drugs by 50%, whether the drug companies like it or not! [cheers & applause] [chanting \"bernie\"]\nbut it is not just amazon, walmart, wall street, or the drug companies. it is the insurance industry as well. you ready to take on the insurance industry? [cheers & applause]\nlast year, the insurance, the five major insurance companies made $20 billion in profit, while maintaining a dysfunctional system that costs us twice as much per capita for health care as any other country. you got that? we spend twice as much per person on health care, as the other countries that provide universal care. and here is what a dysfunctional health care system is about. last year, the ceo of aetna, a mr. bertillini, got a $500 million bonus for engineering a merger between aetna and cvs. [crowd boos]\n34 million americans have no health care. even more are underinsured, with high deductibles and high copayments. and this system allows one man to make $500 million for a merger. well, we have a little different vision. just a little bit. as to what a humane and rational health care system should look like. we believe that health care is a human right, not a privilege! [cheers & applause]\nwe believe that the function of a health care system is to provide quality health care to all people, and not to make billions for the insurance companies and outrageous compensation packages for ceo's. [cheers & applause]\nand that is why, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars the insurance companies and the drug companies will spend against us, i suspect they are going to make me a very famous guy on 30-second tv ads, but despite all of their lying, all of their ads, yes, we will pass a medicare for all single-pair program. [cheers & applause] -- single-payer program. [cheers & applause] [chanting \"bernie\"]\nthe time is long overdue for the united states to end the international embarrassment of being the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all, and we are going to end that embarrassment. [cheers & applause]\nbut it is not just wall street, and the drug companies, and the insurance companies. let me say a a word about something that very few people talk about, and that is, we need to take on the military-industrial complex. [cheers & applause]\nand we say to the military-industrial complex that we will not continue to spend $700 billion a year on the military. we want and need a strong defense, but we do not have to spend more than the next 10 nations combined. [cheers & applause]\nwe are going to invest in education. we are going to invest in affordable housing. we are going to invest in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. but we are not going to invest in never-ending wars! [cheers & applause] [chanting \"bernie\"]\nand while we are on military policy, let me say a word about foreign policy, because they are obviously interrelated. recently, i have been attacked in the media because of my views, actions and votes on foreign policy issues. so let me be as clear as i can be. yes, as a young man, along with dr.. martin luther king jr. and many others, i marched against the war in vietnam. [cheers & applause]\na war which ravaged my generation, which left 59,000 brave young americans dead, as well as killing over one million vietnamese people. i make no apologies for having opposed that war. [cheers & applause]\nas a member of the house of representatives, i helped lead the opposition to the war in iraq. [cheers & applause]\ni did not believe dick cheney or john bolton or president bush and others when they told us that iraq had weapons of mass distraction and that we had to invade that country. the war in iraq turned out to be the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of our country, and has led to the destabilization of that entire region, with more war, more death and more suffering. i make no apology for leading the effort against the war in iraq. [cheers & applause]\nas a member of the senate, recently, i am proud to have been the lead sponsor on a resolution that for the first time in 45 years utilized the war powers act to get a majority vote in the house and the senate to get the united states out of the horrific, saudi-led intervention in yemen. [cheers & applause]\na war that is unauthorized and a war that is unconstitutional. frankly, if we do not end that war soon, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children according to the u.n. will die this year in yemen, and millions more will face starvation in ye ars to come. i make no apologies to anyone for trying to end that horrible war. [cheers & applause]\nand finally, right now, this minute, i am doing everything that i can, working by the way with conservatives in the senate, to prevent donald trump and john bolton from taking us into a war in iran. [cheers & applause] a war which would be in my view much more destructive, if you can believe it, than the war in iraq, and could lead us literally to perpetual warfare in that region. that not only this generation of members of the armed forces would be there, but their kids and their kids. so i make no apologies for trying to do i make no apologies for trying to do everything that i can to make sure this country does not get into another war in the middle east.\nand when we talk about corporate greed and corporate irresponsibility, there can be no greater culprit than the fossil fuel industry and industry which lies to us every day. about the damage that they are doing to our country and the planet. today, we say to donald trump and his friends in the fossil fuel industry, climate change is not a hoax. it is in existential threat to our country and to the entire planet. whether the fossil fuel industry likes it or not, we are going to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. [applause]\ni have seven and children here today. beautiful, beautiful grandchildren and what this struggle of our climate change is about them and every child in this country and in the world. we have a moral responsibility to make sure that the planets we leave those children is a planet that is healthy and is habitable.\nand as your president, i will do everything possible to have the united states bring countries all over the world together, because we have a common enemy in climate change. instead of spending over $1 trillion a year on weapons of destruction all over the world, what's about bringing the countries together to fight the common enemy of climate change?\nand when we talk about justice in this country, we are talking about racial injustice. at a time of overall and massive levels of disparity in the united states, the situation is much worse for african-american families. it is not acceptable to me or to you that black families own 1/10 the wealth that white families own, that the infant mortality rate within the african-american community is 2.5 times higher than the white community. that redlining and housing continues to exist. that black businesses are unable to get the loans that they need. that black school districts are underfunded and that an enormous amount of racism exists within our criminal justice system. so let us be very clear. when we talk about justice, we mean ending institutional racism from one end of this country to the other.\nbrothers and sisters, when we first launched our campaign in 2015, right up in burlington, very few people took that campaign seriously. the ideas that we talked about four years ago were considered by establishment politicians and mainstream media to be radical and extreme ideas. they said that nobody in america would support. well, a lot has happened in the last four years.\nraising the minimum wage to a living wage, not so radical today. guaranteeing health care to all as a human right, not so radical today. creating up to 15 million jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, not so radical today. legalizing marijuana, a radical idea for years ago, not so radical today. and by the way. those ideas that we talked about four years ago that seemed so extreme at the time, today virtually all of those ideas are supported by a majority of the american people and have overwhelming support from democrats and independents and they are ideas that democratic candidates from school board to president are now supporting.\nlet me just conclude by telling you what we're going to do when we make it to the white house.\nwe're going to provide universal and affordable childcare for every family in america.\nwe are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free.\nand we are going to substantially lower the outrageous burden of student debt that people all over this country currently have.\nand when we talk about criminal justice reform, we mean that there will be no more private prisons or detention centers. no more war on drugs. no more heaving people in jail because they are too poor to afford bail.\ntoday, we say that when we were in the white house, we are going to end the demonization of undocumented immigrants in this country.\nwe're going to pass something that is long overdue and that is comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.\nwe're going to provide legal status to the 1.8 million people eligible for the daca program.\nand we will have a humane border policy for those who seek asylum.\nunder our administration, davies will not be snatched from the arms of their mothers.\nunder our administration, amazon, jeff bezos, profitable corporations and the wealthiest people in this country will start paying their fair share of taxes.\nwhen we are in the white house, we are going to end the epidemic of gun violence.\nin this country, and pass the common sense gun safety legislation that the overwhelming majority of americans want. people who should not have guns will\nso let me conclude by saying this. this is a pivotal moment in american history. donald trump and his friends believe they can win the coming election will be dividing us up based on the color of our skin, where we were born, our sexual orientation, or our religion. they think getting us to hate each other is their path to victory. well i have got news for donald trump. that is not a path toward victory. that is a path toward defeat.\nso, while it is true that the 1% in this country and the profitable corporations have enormous wealth and power, it is also true that 1% is 1%. and 99% is a hell of a lot bigger number than 1%.\nso if we stand together and keep our eyes on the prize, we are not only going to win this election, we are going to transform the country and create the kind of nation that you know we can become. thank you all very much.\nbernie!

south carolina democrats. my name is kirsten gillibrand and i am the u.s. senator from new york and i am running to be your next president. i want to tell you a little story that starts about my first opportunity on fox news. not very polite. that's what the fox news host called me during a nationally televised town hall. why you ask? because i walked on to the stage and i started to hold fox news accountable for hours of lies they told about women's reproductive freedom. hours of lies they told about how important our civil rights are, our human rights are and i called them out right on the stage of thain own network. not very polite. you better believe i'm not very polite. i'm never going to be polite when the republican party is attacking our constitutional rights, our human rights, our civil rights to decide when and how many children we're having, under what circumstances. those are our rights. i wasn't very polite when i went down to georgia and i stood up and said we're standing up to legislators across the country. i wasn't very polite when i ran for congress in 2006 in a 2-1 republican district against a four-term incumbent and won twice. i wasn't very polite when both parties were throwing billions at the banks, when the ficial collapse happened around the united states, i voted even as a new york member of congress against a bank bailout twice. i wasn't very polite when i have taken on polluters and fossil fuel companies to guarantee our clean air and clean water, problems you're having right here in south carolina. and i certainly wasn't very prolite when i took on betsy devoss, who doesn't understand public education. you in south carolina know how important our public schools are and when they are crumbling before our eyes and class sizes are too big and not enough money for education, what happens to our kids? so i have taken on the fight that other people won't and i will continue to do that as your president. as your president, i will start where it matters. fighting to pass clean elections. you point to any so-called unsolveable problem in america and i will point to the greed, the corruption, the lies and the special interests that stand in our way, whether it is gun crime, whether it is prescription drug prices, whether it is climate change, there is a special interest, a moneyed interest that is distorting the facts and the truth and changing our voices and overspeaking us by spending unlimited money in these campaigns. once we change whose voices are heard in washington, we can start solving the problems that are still holding so many families back. as president, i will pass medicare for all, because i know we need guaranteed healthcare as a human right. i will fight to strengthen our public schools and ensure that no matter where you live, no matter what block you grew up on, that you will get a good public school education. i will put our teachers first, support higher wages, fully fund special ed, making sure we have community-based scooling and making sure students and parents are receive all of the support they need within our communities and finally, let's put the term minimally adequate on the garbage heap of history. as president, i will take on institutional racism directly. i will look into every issue that plagues this country and pervades every corner of our society from education to healthcare to housing. i will combat these injustices directly and start with making sure we pass reform to fight maternal mortality. it is not right in this day and age if you are a black woman in this country, you are four times more likely to die in child because of racism in our healthcare system. i will make sure we have an economy that actually works for everyone. making sure we can end the wealth cap between white americans and black americans and that starts with postal banking, making sure everyone can have a bank account, a savings account, a checking account and a mortgage. i will empower black business owners and make sure we eliminate the barriers that hold back black entrepreneurs. i will use the f.d.a. to get funds for our black businesses and our women-owned and minority-owned businesses immediately. i will taken to criminal justice system. i will end cash bail on the first day. i will decriminal lies marijuana and mallly legalize it and make sure that the investments are made in the black and brown communities that are harmed by our unfair criminal justice systems. i will no longer fund for profit prisons and make sure we invest in communities, not lock them up. i have a long history in the senate of fighting the battles that nobody else will take on. i have a long history of fighting the battles no one will take on and winning. i have passed major legislation like don't ask, don't tell repeal. like the 9-11 health bill. there is only one way to beat a bully and that is standing up and doing what is right. we know from our leaders, our forebearers, our forefathers like martin luther king jr. that the time is always right to do what's right. each one of us is being called today to fight these battles. the bible tells us we are called to be the light of the world, for all to see, which means taking on the dark powers, putting on the armor of god, putting on the belt of truth, the shield of risheseness. that is how we defeat president trump and it is how we defeat what is wrong in our democracy and how we restore the power to you, the people. glod bless america. applause applause -- god bless america. brk applause brks (music) (music)thank you. thank you, i should have let that music go a little bit longer. we could have gotten some rhythm going. hello, south carolina. thank you so much. it is a privilege and an honor to be here to address you. as most of you know, i'm not a career politician. i'm an entrepreneur and problem solver and i'm here with you all to help solve the problem of our time and the problems speak to this question. how did donald trump win the election of 2016? now there are a bunch of reasons that have been bandied around on cable news and other outlets but i believe the fundamental reason why donald trump is our president today is this. that we send away manufacturing jobs in south carolina, michigan, ohio, pennsylvania, wisconsin, missouri, iowa, all of the swing states he needed to win and did win. my friends in silicon valley believe that we what we did to the four million manufacturing jobs that define many communities and a way of life, we are now going to do onen and on through the do to retail jobs, call center jobs, fast food jobs, truck driving jobs and economy. how many of you have noticed stores close wrg you live in south carolina? i was at this mall and that mall has seen better days. you can see where the sears used to be. where the other mall used to be. it is not just here in south carolina. 30% of american malls are closing in the next four years. and why is that? amazon. that's right. it is a one-word answer. amazon is soaking up delr 20 billion in business and driving 30% of your malls and main street stores to close. how much did amazon pay in taxes last year? that's right. they soak up delr 20 billion out of your communities and you get back zero. what is the number one job in your communities? working in retail at one of these stores that is now closing. the average retail worker is a 39-year-old woman making between dollar 9 and dollar 10 an hour. you pound zero, zero, human, human until you get someone on the line, right? you like that. i do the same thing. i'm pounding zero too. but in two or so years, the software is going to be so good, it is going to sound like this. it is going to say hey, andrew. how are you doing? what can i do for you? you might not even know it is software. what then are the 2.5 million americans who work at call centers going to o do? average call center worker is making delr 12-delr 14 an hour. my friends in silicon valley are working on trucks that can drive themselves. what is that going to mean for those 3.5 million truckers or seven million americans that work at truck stops and hotels? we're in the third inning of the greatest economic and tech logical transformation of our nation's history. donald trump unfortunately is a symptom. what are we going to do about it? if you heard anything about me and my campaign, you heard this. there is an asian man running for president who wants to give everyone delr 1,000 a month pment have you heard that, south carolina? and the first time you heard that, it sounds like a gimmick. it sounds too good to be true, but then you dig into our country's history and you find this is an american idea that is as old as the country itself thomas payne called it a citizen's dividend. martin lirte king jr. was fighting for it in 1967. he called it the guaranteed minimum income. it is what he was fighting for on the day he was assassinated in 1968. it was so mainstream that 1,000 economists signed a study saying this would be tremendous for the country and it passed the house of representatives twice in 1971 under richard nixon and then 11 years later one state actually passed the dividend where everyone in that state gets between delr 1,000 and delr 2,000 a year no questions asked. what state was that? how do they fund it and what is the oil of the 21st century? technology. that's right. what they are doing with oil money in alaska, we can do for everyone here in south carolina and everyone around the country with technology money. again, amazon, trillion dollar tech company paying less in federal taxes than anyone in this room. that equation is not going to work for the people of south carolina. we have to change that. we have to build a trickle up for our people, our families and our communities up. as parent myself, i know what 1,000 a month would mean to the college kid struggling with tuition and room and board bills. i know what it would mean to a single mom stuck in a cramped apartment trying to figure out how the create a better path for their kids. for the delerl south carolina ian. this dividend is how we change the game and start recognizing people like my wife who is at moment with our two young boys, one of whom is autistic. what is her worth in g.d.p. now? we know that is nonsense. we know her work is among the most challenging and vital work that is done in our society today. the democratic party talks about empowering women and i'm going to suggest to you all that the best way to help that waitress getting harassed by her boss or the single mom stuck in an abuse incomplete pass relationship, the best way to empower those women is to put delr 1,000 in their hands. we can talk about empowering women or do something about it. i say we do something about it. so thises a vision of an economy that we must take to the rest of the country as fast as possible. we do not have that much time. this rests on you all. the democrats why all of the candidates are here today is we know you will choose the next president. we have to make this happen as fast as possible. my friend jermaine johnson said the motto of this state is while i breathe i hope. and if you are all here today, i know you're more about fighting than breathing. well, we fight, we hope. we have to fight for a brighter future for the people here in south carolina. we have to fight for a brighter future for the people of this country in 2020. i'm thrilled to

[cheers and applause] >> rock hill. rock hill, rock hill, rock hill, rock hill. give me that other cordless mic. rock hill, it is such a pleasure an honor to be here at clinton college. i was fortunate enough to be the keynote speaker at this college and it is such a pleasure to be here on a campus that is rooted in a tradition. this college is about 125 years old and it was founded by folks who had a dream. who understood that education is a pathway to freedom, and we all are excited to be here. i want to hold up here for rock hill. i know all of you understand the history of this community, but this book right here, \"no fear for freedom.\" and i want to thank the good doctor kimberly and mr. mccloud, who i believe is in the audience today. i want to thank this community for standing up and doing what is right, and in the same way that others have done the right thing, we have the obligation to continue to build on doing the right thing. no fear for freedom. [cheers and applause]. show less text no fear for freedom and that is what the campaign of senator bernie sanders is all about -- no fear for freedom. the freedom to live a good life. the freedom to have health care. the freedom to not be saddled with debt. the freedom to have peace of mind. the freedom to have opportunity. the freedom to have a good life. and we can do this in the wealthiest country on the face of the earth, sisters and brothers, we can do this. i want you, if you will, rock hill, to raise one hand for yourself and one hand for somebody else. i need you to participate with me sisters and brothers. one hand for yourself and one hand for somebody else. and with these hands, we will have medicare for all. with these hands we will college for all. with these hands, women will be able to control their bodies. with these hands we will get our whole damn dollar, ladies. with these hands, we will take care of mother earth. with these hands, we will take care of our elderly. with these hands, we will assure fair, humane immigration reform. with these hands we will overhaul a racist criminal justice system. and with these hands, we will dream big dreams. and with these hands we will elect senator bernie sanders, the next president of the united states of\namerica. [cheers and applause] >> thank you. [crowd chanting \"bernie\"] >> thank you. thank you. please. it does sound like rock hill, south carolina, is ready for a political revolution, and i thank you all. now, i love campaigning, but the only problem that i have is that i always have got to follow nina turner, and that's hard. and then you've got danny glover there as well. so i want to thank nina and danny and jim thompson and dr. mchorne for allowing us to use the campus of this great college. thank you very much. what this campaign is about is a very profound concept. we just talked about it earlier today. we were meeting with some local folks, and somebody raised the issue of what we are entitled to -- what we are entitled to as human beings in the wealthiest country on the history of the world. what are we entitled to? now, i believe that what we must strive for is a government not based on racism, not based on sexism, not based on homophobia, not based on xenaphobia, and not based on religious bigotry. in fact -- in fact, what our campaign is about is exactly the opposite of what trump is trying to do. he is trying to divide us up, our campaign brings us together. and it brings us together, black and white and latino, native american, asian american, it brings us together in the struggle for economic justice, for social justice, for racial justice, and for environmental justice. [cheers and applause] it brings us together in the belief that the american people are entitled to an economy and a government which works for all of us, not just the 1%. now, this campaign is asking you to think big, not small. it is asking you to imagine the kind of country we can and must become. and it is also asking you to take a hard look at the country we are today and how we can do better. now, i know i get criticized by a lot of people. all right. that's right. when you say -- when you talk truth to power, you sometimes get criticized. so this afternoon we are going to talk truth to power. and we're going to ask ourselves a few questions. we're going to ask ourselves whether it is moral and whether it is right that in america today three people own more wealth than the bottom half of america? whether it is appropriate that the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 92%. whether it is good economics 9% of all new income goes to the top 1%. now, we raised those questions because most candidates, most members of congress and the media does not talk about that. so what we are about is creating an economy and a country that works for all, and what does that mean? let's start off by taking a look at jobs and the economy. right now in this great state, you've got tens and tens of thousands of workers earning a starvation wage. now, four years ago when i came here to south carolina, i proposed something that everybody said was radical and extreme. i said that if you work 40 hours a week in the united states of america, you should not be living in poefrt, that -- poverty, that we have got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. [cheers and applause] and that living wage is at least $15 an hour. [cheers and applause] now, four years ago i was told that i was somewhat crazy for proposing an idea that would more than double the federal minimum wage. you know what happened since? that crazy idea has now been adopted by seven states in america. and unless i am very mistaken, and i am not, the u.s. house of representatives is going to vote for a $15 and pass a $15 an hour minimum wage in the next several weeks. [cheers and applause] and i need you to tell your republican senators here when that bill comes from the house to the senate that people cannot live on $8 an hour or $9. they need to vote for a $15 an hour minimum wage. [cheers and applause] and when we talk about raising wages, we're going to end the obsurdity of women making less money than men. we will have equal pay for equal work. and -- and when we talk about women's rights -- when we talk about women's rights, let me be as clear as i can be. i believe that women have the constitutional right in this country to control their own bodies. [cheers and applause] and i pledge to you -- i pledge to you that i will never nominate anybody to the u.s. supreme court who is not 100% in favor of defending roe versus wade. four years ago when i came to south carolina, i made another radical idea. i said maybe in the united states we should do what every other major country on earth does and guarantee health care as a right to all people. [cheers and applause] i am sick and tired of talking to doctor who tell me that patients walk into their offices too late because they have no health insurance or because they are under insured with high deductibles and high co-payments. the function of a rational health care system is to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way, not to make billions in profits for the insurance company. [cheers and applause] and that is why together -- that is why together we will pass a medicare for all single-payer program. [cheers and applause] and when we talk about our dysfunctional health care system, it means that we are going to take on the pharmaceutical industry, the top ten drug companies last year made $69 billion in profits and millions of americans cannot afford the medicine they need because we are forced to pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. so we got news for the drug companies. they are going to stop ripping off the american people. we're going to cut drug costs in half -- in half. [cheers and applause] we live in a competitive global economy, and all of you know that to make it into the middle class, by and large, people need a good quality higher education, like the people are getting here at clinton college. [cheers and applause] and, yet, despite that reality, we've got hundreds of thousands of bright young people who cannot afford to go to college or get the training they need to go out and get a good-paying job. now, the truth is 50 or 60 years ago, you had -- if you had a high school degree, the odds are that you could go out and make it into the middle class. but the world has changed, technology has changed, the economy has changed and today people need that higher education. and that is why i believe that we have got to make public colleges and universities tuition free. [cheers and applause] not a radical idea. it exists in countries all over the world. and in addition to that, we have got to very, very substantially reduce the burden of student debt on our people. [cheers and applause] and tomorrow -- tomorrow in washington i'm going to be making a big announcement. i want to hold off until i make it tomorrow. but basically this is what we're going to be saying. we're going to being saying that it is a little bit crazy for people to what they have to do, which is to get a quality education and then find themselves in the absurd position of having to pay that debt off for decades. and some of those people, they can't afford to get married, they can't afford to have kids, they can't afford to buy their own home. well, we are going to change that. [cheers and applause] now, some of you may remember that ten years ago, against my vote, as it happens, the congress voted to bail out the crooks on wall street. do you remember that? they provided $700 billion in federal loans, and in addition, trillions of dollars in zero or very-low interest loans. so i think the time is now for wall street to repay that obligation to the american people. [cheers and applause] if we could bail out wall street, we sure as hell can reduce student debt in this country. [cheers and applause] president trump believes climate change is a hoax. [crowd jeering] president trump does not believe in science. it is time we had somebody in the white house who understands that climate change is not a hoax but that it is an extensional threat to this country and to the planet. [cheers and applause] and it is time long overdue that we told the fossil fuels industry that they cannot continue through their carbon emissions to destroy this planet for short-term profits. [cheers and applause] and that is why together we are going to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energies. and in the process we are going to create millions of good-paying jobs. [cheers and applause] you have a lot of sunshine here in south carolina, and it is time that this state and the rest of this country use that sunshine to create energy. [cheers and applause] and we talk about disparities in this country between the very rich and everybody else. we are also talking about racial disparities. [cheers and applause] and that means we end the -- end -- the absurdity of white families having ten times more wealth than black families. it means that we end the disparity in health care where the infant mortality rate in the black community is two and a half times higher than in the white community. [cheers and applause] it means that we end the disparities in education where black school districts are substantially underfunded. [cheers and applause] it means that we end the disparity in ficial services where small black businesses can't get the loans that they need. [cheers and applause] and it means that once and for all we are going to reform a broken and racist criminal justice system. [cheers and applause] today, and i want you all to hear this -- but today in america we have more people in jail, about two million people -- more people in jail than any other country on earth, including china, four times our size. we are spending about $80 billion at the local state and federal level locking up fellow americans. now, i happen to believe that it makes more sense to use some of that $80 billion to invest in our young people in jobs for these kids and in education . [cheers and applause] show less text rather than building more jails and having more incarceration. [cheers and applause] it costs more money to send somebody to jail than to send them to the university of south carolina. let's get our priorities right. let's educate, not incarcerate. [cheers and applause] and when we talk about education, we're also talking about a very significant increase in funding for hbcu's. [cheers and applause] when we talk about criminal justice -- you know, i was here four years ago talking about criminal justice, and i said, you know what? i think that the time is right to end the so-called war on drugs. [cheers and applause] well, four years ago that seemed like a radical idea, not so radical today. state after state after state is either decriminalizing or legalizing the possession of marijuana. [cheers and applause] and some communities are even going further and expunging the records of those arrested for the possession of marijuana. [cheers and applause] so when i talk about criminal justice reform, we are talking about also ending cash bail in this country. [applause] right now -- right now, quite unbelievable, hundreds of thousands of fellow americans are in jail today and their crime is they are poor. they haven't been convicted of anything. they can't afford bail. that is absurd. we are going to end that practice. and we are going to end private prisons and detention centers in this country. and when we talk about reform, we should be aware that, as we speak, millions of people in this country are living in terrible, terrible fear, and those are the undocumented people. and, in my view, instead of having a president who demonizes people because they came from abroad, people who are undocumented, we need to work together for comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship. [cheers and applause] we need -- we need to provide immediate legal status to the 1. 8 million young people eligible for the daca program. and we need a humane bored policy, not a policy that tears babies from the arms of their mothers. [cheers and applause] now, my friends, you all know that we are living in an unprecedented moment in american history. and the results of this election will very clearly determine the future of america. one choice that we have is moving this country further and further into oligarchy where a handful of billionaires exert unbelievable power over the economic and political life of this country. that is one direction we can go. [crowd jeering] or the other direction that we can go is to create a vibrant democracy where we are not suppressing the votes. [cheers and applause] where we are not making it harder for people of color or poor people or young people to vote but making it easier for people to vote. [cheers and applause] and where we can create an economy that is based on justice that works for all of us. those are the choices that we face. now, when i announced for president, what i said -- and it was not an easy decision, i should tell you because when you run for president nowadays, you get attacked by everybody and your family gets attacked, but we decided to run for two reasons. number one, i happen to believe that i am the strongest candidate to defeat the worst president in the history of this country. [cheers and applause] [chanting \"bernie] >> every poll that has ever been done in the last year has us running ahead of trump, and in recent weeks, those numbers are pretty significant. i believe that we can defeat trump in battleground states like michigan and pennsylvania, wisconsin. recent polls had us ahead of him even in florida and north carolina. and you know what i think? with your energy and your enthusiasm, i think we've got a shot here in south carolina. [cheers and applause] so the first reason that my wife and i decided that we should do this is because we have a moral imperative to defeat the worst president in the modern history of america. but there's a second reason. there is a second reason which goes beyond defeating trump. it is the imperative to create a government and an economy that is based on justice. a government that is based on honesty, not lies. [cheers and applause] but let me tell you something that i believe no other candidate will tell you. many of the people running are personal friends of mine. they are decent and good people. and they know, by the way, who i know. is that whoever ends up winning this democratic primary, all of us will rally around that person. [cheers and applause] and what i have said before, i certainly hope that person is me. [cheers and applause] but if it is not, i will do everything -- i can to support that candidate and defeat trump. but the second reason -- so the first reason that i'm in this is to make sure that trump is defeated, but the second reason is equally as important. so obviously i am here in south carolina to ask for your support to win the democratic primary here. i am asking for your support to win the democratic nomination. i am asking your support, if nominated, to defeat trump. but i am asking something more of you -- i'm asking something more of you, and i think that maybe distinguishes our campaign from other campaigns of the message of our campaign, as you may have seen, is us, not me. us not me. and what it that means is, i think, two things. i think that means we are all, as americans, in this together. my job is to worry about you and your family, your job is to worry about me and my family. that is what being an american is about. but the second thing that us, not me means is something very profound, which you're not going to see much on t.v. or in the media, and that is for 45, 50 years, the american people have seen politicians giving great speeches, sincere speeches, honest speeches, they've seen party platforms that have been good and strong, they've seen strong legislation being passed. but today the average american worker is earning in real inflation accounted-for dollars exactly what he or she earned 45 years 45 years ago. so after all of the speeches, after all of the great technology that we have seen, after all of the worker productivity which means the average worker is reducing much, much more than 30 years ago, the average person in the middle of our economy is no better off in real dollars. second of all, in the last 30 years, listen to this, according to federal reserve data, the top 1% have seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth. the bottom 50% of our people have seen a $900 billion decline in their wealth. [crowd jeering] now why does that happen? how does it happen? and what we have got to begin to deal with is where the real power in this country rests. all right. it is not that candidates are insincere when they come before you. they want to do this and they want to do that, and they do, but somehow or another it never happens, and it never happens because we have yet to deal with the power of wall street. [cheers and applause] the six largest banks in america have assets equivalent to 54% of the gdp in america. they control the flow of trillions of dollars. they determine whether factories stay in the u.s. or go to china, they determine whether workers earn a living wage or a starvation wage. we are not going to have progress in this country until we have the courage to deal with wall street, but it is not just wall street. the american people understand that health care is a right. they know that the system is dysfunctional when we spend twice as much per person on health care as do people of any other country. we want medicare for all, but in order to get that, we are going to have to take on the insurance companies and all of their moneys and all of their power. [cheers and applause] the american people are disgusted at the high cost of prescription drugs. everybody knows that we've got to lower the cost of medicine, but in order to do that, you can't just give a speech. you've got to have the guts to tell the pharmaceutical industry, you are going to stop your greed. we are going to substantially lower prescription drug costs. and it is not good enough to give great speeches about the crisis in climate change. we all know that that's real. but what we have got to do is to have the courage to take on the billionaires who own the fossil fuels industry. so what i am asking you for is your help, not just to win the nomination and to defeat trump, i'm asking for your help in something beyond that. and that is to understand that real change in this country does not be never has happened unless millions of people at the grassroots level stand up and fight back and demand justice. that is the history of the labor movement. that is the history of the civil rights movement. that is the history of the women's movement. that is the history of the gay rights movement. power never gives up their power voluntarily. wall street is not going to say, oh, i guess we should do the right thing and lower interest rates for consumers in this country. fossil fuels industry is not going to say, oh, yeah, climate change is real. i guess we've got to go to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. that's not the way it happens or ever happens. change happens when people have the courage to stand up to the powers that be. [cheers and applause] so today i am asking your help, not just to win this thing but to understand that the only way we bring about real change is when we work together, when tens of millions of people demand justice. so we have the opportunity in this election not only to defeat the worst president in the modern history of this country but to transform our nation and to become the people we know we can become. thank you all very much. [cheers and applause] [indiscernible conversations] [indiscernible conversations] the 46th president, bernie sanders. [indiscernible conversations] thank you. thank you, senator.
